Reliable gallery supporting user galleries on the frontend besides the standard features like watermarkes and subgalleries. It is accompanied by modules and plugins so it can be as lean as needed

RSGallery2 is a component of the "early" days of joomla.
It launched in 2005 and reached its peak around 2008 when it was mentioned in several books

###Description
RSGallery2 is a full featured, easy to use, highly customisable, gallery component for Joomla!

* Users can upload their images via frontend and backend, via single file upload, batch upload or ftp upload. 
* Galleries containing images can have as many (nested) subgalleries as you want. Galleries and images can be moved around easily. 
* Three graphics libraries, used to make display and thumbnail images, are supported: GD2, ImageMagick and Netpbm. 
* Images can have a watermark. Images can be regenerated after the settings for display image size and thumbnail image size are changed. 
* Detailed access rights management
* User galleries on front end
The site administrator can set permissions for usergroups to be allowed to upload images, create galleries, edit, delete, (un)publish both images and galleries, vote and comment on images, just like the permissions for Joomla core components are set. View access for galleries can be set by the site administrator just like view acces for Joomla Categories. 
* The look and feel can be customised by creating your own RSGallery2 templates. (deprecated)

RSGallery2 has been around since the Mambo days and was originally developed by Ronald Smit. Since then, RSGallery2 has evolved into what it is nowadays.

###Upgrade instructions
Create a full backup of your files and database, as always before making changes to your site. 
Note: upgrade will automatically overwrite all RSGallery2 system files, but it will leave your images untouched. So if you made any changes to the templates that are shipped with RSGallery2 they will be overwritten! You either have to backup the template or redo any custom changes after upgrading. Also, the comments in the database will be converted from BBCode format to HTML format.

On Joomla 2.5
Go to the Backend > Extensions > Install/Uninstall > Browse… (find the downloaded file) > Click Upload File & Install
