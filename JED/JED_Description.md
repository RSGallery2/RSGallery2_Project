###Description
RSGallery2 is a full featured, easy to use, highly customizable, gallery component for Joomla!

* Users can upload their images via frontend and backend, via single file upload, batch upload or ftp upload.
* Galleries containing images can have as many (nested) sub galleries as you want. Galleries and images can be moved around easily.
* Three graphics libraries, used to make display and thumbnail images, are supported: GD2, ImageMagick and Netpbm.
* Images can have a watermark. Images can be regenerated after the settings for display image size and thumbnail image size are changed.
* Detailed access rights management
* User galleries on front end
The site administrator can set permissions for user groups to be allowed to upload images, create galleries, edit, delete, (un)publish both images and galleries, vote and comment on images, just like the permissions for Joomla! core components are set. View access for galleries can be set by the site administrator just like view access for Joomla! Categories.
* The look and feel can be customized by creating your own RSGallery2 templates. (deprecated)

RSGallery2 has been around since the Mambo days and was originally developed by Ronald Smit. Since then, RSGallery2 has evolved into what it is nowadays.
