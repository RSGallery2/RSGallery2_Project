2021.03.27: The sources and installation lives actually in github repository RSGallery2 / RSGallery2_J4

This documentation is a work in progress and will be updated regularly. 
It is the collection of all markdown files from github 
[Project documentation Repository](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/tree/master/Documentation/J!4x). 
There may be an updated version of this document. 
We may update it once in a while on new features. 

We are sorry for "some" ugly parts of the style. This results from the limitation of writing in fast "Markdown syntax".

# Upload

[ ] ToDo: fill out see: RSGallery2_Project\Documentation\J!3x\Upload\upload.md  Manches ist ähnlich, manches muss verändert werden 

![Upload startview](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/Upload.start.png?raw=true)

There are three tabs to choose

- (1) Upload by drag and drop
- (2) Upload from Zip file (PC)
- (3) Upload from folder (server)

## Upload by drag and drop

On "Upload by drag and drop" a form opens where the properties of a image to be uploaded can be edited. This includes the origin of the image as properties like name, assigned gallery and more.

More images can be added in that form.

![Drag and Drop](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/Upload.DragAndDrop.01.png?raw=true)

(1) Specify gallery

First select an existing gallery This will enable drag and drop ands display the drop area in green

(2) Drag and drop area

The drag and drop area is marked with a red or green dotted border. The color changes to green when a gallery is selected. An error message appears when a image is dropped while the border is red.<br>
When images are dropped then they are transferred to the server and assigned to the gallery. The display-, thumb- and watermarked images are created and on success the image is displayed in the drag and drop area.<br>
Ass soon as the image is displayed it is secure to assume that the image is stored in the database and assigned to the gallery

(3) Select files

This is an other way to select multiple images form a folder on the PC- Press this button and you can move to the image folder and select several images to be downloaded. On exit these files are downloaded

This is especially helpful if your operation system remembers the last selected folder and displays it again for the image upload

(4) Add image properties

After the dropped images appear (are shown) in their area here is provided a batch handling to assign the properties "title" and "description" More below on description of the "Properties uploaded images" view

Tip: This functionality can also be reached from the image list view. Select the images to be handled and use button batch and the select "Images Properties" button

(5) Upload single images (Legacy) This button leads to the old "legacy" version of single image upload.<br>
When the drag and drop function has enough experience and no user complains then drag and drop is faster and this function will be removed

(6) Upload file size On the bottom is shown the setting of some php variables from the system (from php.ini file) related to the upload process. Even if the file itself complies with all limits the upload itself may fail.

### Restrictions

- File size: The upload may hang if the file size is too big. The working file size is not only dependent on the system settings for upload (see point (6)). Also the used library (GD see configuration) may stumble

### Upload files using drag and drop: View after some uploads

![Upload start view](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/Upload.DragAndDrop.02.png?raw=true)

(1) Drag and drop area (filled) After a gallery is selected the dotted border is green. Dropped images do appear in this area after the transfer process is completed.

(2) Process bars

For each dropped file a progress bar appears. It is red as long as the file is not completely transferred. In each state it tells the amount of transferred parts of the file.

Attention: Even if the green bar is at 100% telling that the file is completely transferred the server needs time to create the dependent rsgallery2 images and the process is not finished until the matching image is displayed in the drag and drop area

(3) Add image properties

A click on button "Add image properties" will lead to a page where properties can be assigned to all shown images at once (batch). The title and the description properties can be edited there. This is similar to the second page on upload in previous rsgallery2 versions.

It is not necessary to use this view when no title or description editing needed.

Info: On creation of the image data on the server side the title is preset from the image name automatically.

## Upload from Zip file (PC)

A zip file containing several images can be uploaded to the server, unzipped and the images assigned to a gallery.

![Upload from Zip file (PC)](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/Upload.fromZip.png?raw=true)

(1) Select the zip file on local pc folder

Attention: The size of all files within the zip file has to be smaller than the server settings (php.ini) upload_max_filesize and post_max_size. These values are displayed in red below this input.

(2) Specify gallery

The list on the right contains all gallery names. The top most gallery is the last one created.

(3) Upload Zip file

Does upload the zip file to the server, unzip the images and jumps to properties "uploaded images view". There the images are displayed and the properties can be assigned.

See section "Properties uploaded Files" view below ToDo: Link

(4) Upload Zip file (legacy)

This button leads to the old "legacy" version of zip file upload.<br>
When the new function has enough experience and no user complains then this function will be removed.

## Upload from folder (server)

Images can be uploaded to a folder (Shall be created) within the Joomla! installation. The images will be copied from this folder and will be assigned to the gallery

![Upload from folder (server)](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/Upload.fromFtpPath.png?raw=true)

(1) FTP Path Defines the path where RSGallery2 will look for images to "upload" The path may be any otherwise empty folder which is accessible (has rights) from within the Joomla! installation. Recommended is a folder TransferImages in images The path must start with the base path to Joomla! installation. To make things easier the standard path is given in small font below the input.

In configuration the standard path can be set so it will be automatically filled in.

(2) Specify gallery

The list on the right contains all gallery names. The top most gallery is the last one created

(3) Upload images

Does copy the files from given folder on the server and jumps to "Images batch upload" view. There the images are displayed and the properties can be assigned.

See form "Images batch upload" view below ToDo: link

(4) Upload Zip file (legacy)

This button leads to the old "legacy" version of zip file upload.<br>
When the new function has enough experience and no user complains then this function will be removed.

## Properties uploaded Files

![Upload startview](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/Upload.ImageProperties.png?raw=true)

This form enables to set the properties title and description for a batch of images at the same time.<br>
It is normally reached over the upload form. It can also be reached with selected images over the batch button in the images list form

(1) Title

The title is preset on creation. It may be edited here. The title may be different to the uploaded image name when the name already existed. Then the next free number is appended.

(2) Gallery

The gallery name can't be changed in this part

(3) Description

The description may be changed with the standard editor like in the edit single image form.<br>
Sadly this leads to a very high edit block which creates a ugly layout.

(4) Save

Save changes and continue edit on the same images

(5) Save & Close

Save changes and leave the form to the image list

(6) Cancel

Ignore the changes and leave the form

(7) Delete

All or some image can be selected for deleting. (See (8) and (9)) Clicking on the delete button will delete the selected images from the RSGallery2 database and the created image files

(8) Rotate left

Rotates selected images 90 degrees against the clock

(9) Rotate right

Rotates selected images 90 degrees with the clock

(10) Rotate 180

Rotates selected images 180 degrees.

(11) Flip horizontal

Flips the selected images horizontal. The bits move from left to right. The bottom of the image keeps being the bottom

(12) Flip vertical

Flips the selected images vertical. The bits move from bottom to top. The left/right side of the image keeps being the left/right side

(13) Select all

All images will get a set hook in the box below the image (See also (14)) This can be used to delete, rotate or flip selected images.

(14) Select image

The image will get a set hook in the box below the image This can be used to delete, rotate or flip selected images.

## Images: Batch process to add properties

In the images list view images can be selected for batch processing. The following image shows the possible selections which appear after clicking the batch button

![Upload startview](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/images.batch.upload.png?raw=true)

(1) Add properties

This button leads to the properties form (See above) and will open the selected images. So the title and description can be changed for a batch of images

## How to fix ajax upload errors

In cases where the the upload got stuck you may see a error message and the result looks like below

....

In most cases the image data is reserved in the database but the image is not uploaded.

Then you may upload the image by FTP to the rsgallery2 "original" destination folder and start the creation of the display and thumb images manual by using a maintenance function

### 1\. Check the database reservation / images existence

![Upload startview](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/controlPanel.baseButtons.maintenance.png?raw=true)

In "control panel" select Maintenance

![Upload startview](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/Maintenance.Repair.ConsolidateImageDB.Button.png?raw=true)

There select in section "Repair zone" the button "Consolidate image database". This will lead to a page where it is checked whether there are database entries for missing images or for images with no database / gallery connection

![Upload startview](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/maintenance.consolidate.onlyDbItem.png?raw=true)

### 2\. Upload image

The original images are kept in folder in .../Joomla/images/rsgallery/original. Copy your file into this folder.

![Upload startview](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/maintenance.consolidate.DbAndOriginalImg.png?raw=true)

(1) Use button "Repeat checking" so the image is found<br>
(2) If the image exists it is marked here<br>
(3) Select the line with clicking on marker in front<br>
(4) Use button "Create missing images".<br>
If all goes well then the line of this image will disappear in the next display of the page

### General folders of RSGallery2 images

(2018.07.03) ....

The images are kept in following folders in .../Joomla/images/rsgallery/**sub_folder**

- original: Users original images if not disabled in configuration
- display: Resized images (size from configuration)
- thumbs: Thumbs of images (size and form from configuration)
- watermarked: When watermark is active then images which were shown to the user get a watermark and are saved here for fast access

# Configuration




## Maintenance functions

[ ] ToDo: fill out see: RSGallery2_Project\Documentation\J!3x\GalleriesBackend\GalleryEditView.md (Needs completion of edit view first, kann für vorhandene Teile gestartet werden)

The maintenance form supports with sub forms several functions to check and repair the rsgallery2 image and database universe.

Each grey array is a button to click on. In most cases a sub form will open where more info or actions are provided

<br>


![Base top](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/maintenance.base.top.png?raw=true)

![Base bottom](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/maintenance.base.bottom.png?raw=true)

### Zones

* Rsgallery2 zone

  Handles slideshows and templates

* Repair zone

  The image file system can be checked to match the database. Also the configuration can be checked here.

* Danger zone

  Delete database entries and database structure

* Raw database zone

   A window to the pure content of the database (lists)

* Outdated zone

   Door to old view of functions like image/galleries lists

* Upgrade (from 1.x / 2.x) zone

  Helpers after upgrading RSG2 from previous J!x versions


## Rsgallery2 zone
![zone.RSGallery2](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/maintenance.zone.RSGallery2.png?raw=true)

(1) Slideshow configuration

Edit and check the configuration parameters of installed slideshows.
Leads to a separate view for the edit of slideshow parameter.
<br> See separate maintenance document ""

(2) Comments list

Enters list view of comments

(3) Template manager

Actually not working. (2014-2018)<br>
In older version it had the function to upload slideshows and templates for the display of the gallery in frontend. These could be edited or deleted also.


## Repair zone
![zone.repair.png](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/maintenance.zone.repair.png?raw=true)

(1) Consolidate image database

The consistence of the database to image files can be checked here. The following view supports the check and repair of image orphans in database or as missing image files.

<br> (See separate maintenance document "")

(2) Configuration Raw edit

Edit view of all config variables including internal settings. Prepared for debug and emergency situations. Lists all variables in alphabetical order. The values can be changed and saved.

(4) Regenerate display images

(5) Optimize database

## Danger zone
![maintenance.zone.danger.png](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/maintenance.zone.danger.png?raw=true)

(1) Purge tables (data) & delete all images

Supports the first step to remove RSGgallery2 completely.

Therefore the content (items) in all RSGaller2 tables are removed. Additionally the image files are deleted. The data structure is kept but is empty.

This can also be used to purge the data and start again empty with new images and new galleries.


If afterwards the component is de installed nothing shall be left and remind of RSGallery2

(2) Remove RSGallery2 tables and images
The previous intention was to support the uninstall that by removing databases tables and image files. The side effect of this function was that Joomla! did start with error and RSGallery2 could not be uninstalled

Instead of using this function  begin with above function 'Purge tables (data)'
See following instruction for a complete remove

### How to remove RSGALLERY2 completely

(1) Use Maintenance -> Purge tables

This removes the database content and the image files

(2) Prepare the remove of database table structure

Search in admin rsgallery2 folder \administrator\components\com_rsgallery2\sql\ for file uninstall.mysql.utf8.sql. Edit the file and remove the comments in front of the drop commands.

(3) Standard uninstall

Use finally standard Joomla uninstall to get rid of all parts of RSGallery2


## Raw database zone
![zone.rawDatabase.png](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/maintenance.zone.rawDatabase.png?raw=true)

The buttons lead to the pure content view of the database lists

(1) Configuration variables

Shows a list with actual values of all configuration variables

(2) Images list

Shows a list with the database properties of all images. This contains more columns as the normal image view.

(3) Galleries list

Shows a list with the database properties of all galleries. This contains more columns as the normal image view.

(4) Comments list

Shows a list with the database properties of all comments. This contains more columns as the normal image view.


## Outdated zone

![maintenance.zone.outDated.png](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/maintenance.zone.outDated.png?raw=true)

Door to old view of functions like image/galleries lists
These buttons lead to the previous views of RSG2 around 2013 or beginning of J3x<br>
the functionality is not granted as this old code is not maintained any more. Still it may be a hint what has improved over this time


(1) Configuration

%

(2) Mange galleries

%

(3) Manage images

%

(4) Upload single images

%

(5) Consolidate database

  Don't use. It is only listed for completeness

## Upgrade (from 1.x / 2.x) zone


![maintenance.zone.outDated.png](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J!3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/maintenance.zone.Upgrade1x2x.png?raw=true)

(1) Database

  Repair missing database tables, table columns and ...
  This function reassigns the actual SQL definitions. Therefore new tables, new columns are added and not supported columns are removed

  This is useful when upgrading from a real old version and general list can not be viewed

(2) Create gallery "access" field

   On upgrade from 1.x this table field was missing. Here it will be created and all values set to one

(3) Delete RSG2 base language files

  Deletes RSGallery2 languages files in joomla base language folders. The RSG2 base translation files are located in ...\administrator\languages. These may overwrite new RSG2 language items kept in component language folder. <br>
  Use this function  when an update installation does not overwrite "old" base language files and translations do not appear or appear as old.
