# Gallery id's 

The table for galleries is similar to a categories binary tree. 
The first Id '1' is used as the root of the tree and therefore 
can not be assigned to a gallery id

In the development change to nested gallery parent ID 0 needed to  be removed

## Parent gallery id '0'

Therefore parent id '0' like in J3x is not allowed

## Parent gallery id '1'

Parent id '1' defines 'no parent'



## DB Nested ...

The first Id '1' is used as the root of the tree

??? Save failed with the following error: Invalid `parent_id` [0] in Rsgallery2\Component\Rsgallery2\Administrator\Table\GalleryTable::check() ????


## J3x version 
A gallery number of "0" defined 'no parent'
