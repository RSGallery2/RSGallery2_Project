## RSGallery2 bootstrap

On entering a URL the server has to load com_rsgallery2 files besides Joomla! itself.

In this folder the initialising bootstrap proces will be documented a little. It tells a bit about which php files will be loaded and functions will be called in which order

This documentation is valid for the version 2.5 and 3.5 until the J3.5 standard view model is used. ? RSG2 4.4 ++ ?
As writing this it is not clear in which version the site has updated
