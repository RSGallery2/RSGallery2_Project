Accessing RSG2 configuration settings are very easy.  For example, the following code will tell you if RSG2 debug is enabled: 
global $rsgConfig;
if( $rsgConfig->get( 'debug' )) echo 'Debug enabled!'; 
  
Tips For Debugging 
Configuration values are kept in database table #__rsgallery2_config.  This table and it's values persist across RSG2 upgrades/installations. 
If you enable debug in the configuration, you will be presented with other options in the RSGallery2 Control Panel for accessing the configuration.  Configuration Raw Edit is one convienent tool which presents a raw view of all configuration names and values and allows you to change them to anything.
