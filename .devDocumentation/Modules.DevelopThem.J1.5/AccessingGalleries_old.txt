Learn to access and use galleries represented by rsgGallery objects with the rsgGalleryManager. 
rsgGalleryManager's public functions check with rsgAccess to ensure only information allowed is shown to a user. 
The most used function of rsgGalleryManager is get() which retrieves a gallery represented by an rsgGallery object: 
$gallery = rsgGalleryManager::get( $galleryID );  
The following example retreives shows a list of of all galleries in the top level.  It prints the name and the thumbnail image linking to the gallery: 
$top = rsgGalleryManager::get( 0 );

foreach( $top->kids() as $kid ){
    echo <<<EOD
    <br />
    {$kid->get('name')}
    <a xhref='{$kid->url}'>
    {$kid->thumbHTML}
    </a>
EOD;
}
