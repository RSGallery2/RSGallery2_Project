  <title>Frontend</title>

  <para>The intention of this chapter is to show you what RSGallery2 looks
  like using its default template Semantic on Joomla 2.5.x with its default
  template Beez2. Two assumptions are made: you are not logged in unless
  stated otherwise, and you have created a menu item called Photos linking to
  RSGallery2 (see <xref linkend="sec-create-RSGalelry2-menu-item" />). These
  are the galleries that are set up (just like in <xref
  linkend="sec-example-galleries" />).</para>

  <para>Whenever something is shown that depends on a configuration setting
  set in the backend, the setting name will be mentioned in parenthesis. See
  section <xref linkend="sec-Configuration-Settings" /> for further
  information on these, and more, settings.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Main page</title>

    <para>Go to your frontend and locate the menu item Photos (see <xref
    linkend="fig-Frontend_with_Photos_menu_item" />). When you click on the
    menu item Photos you are taken to RSGallery2's main page (<xref
    linkend="fig_Frontend_MainPage" />). The page shows three galleries:
    Cakes, Flowers and Hollidays each with some details:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Gallery Name, e.g. Cakes.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A link to a slideshow for this gallery (setting Display
        Slideshow and setting Select slideshow).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The owner of the gallery, which is admin in the figure shown
        here (setting Display Owner Information).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The size of the gallery, e.g. 6 images for gallery Cakes
        (setting Display number of items in gallery).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The creation date of the gallery (setting Display creation
        date).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If the gallery has subgalleries, these are mentioned here with
        the number of images they contain. E.g. Gallery Hollidays has two
        subgalleries.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The thumbnail next to the details is a link to the images that are
    in the gallery. This thumbnail can either be one of the thumbnail images
    for this gallery at random, or you can select a specific one. See <xref
    linkend="sec-create-a-gallery" />, setting Gallery thumbnail.</para>

    <para>Directly above these three galleries is a search box (setting
    Display Search) that allows the user to search within gallery and image
    titles and descriptions. Below these three galleries is a block with
    Random images (setting Display Random) and a block with the Latest
    (uploaded) images (setting Display Latest).</para>

    <para>Also notice the pathway, just above the About Joomla! menu, that
    indicates 'Home &gt; Photos' in the figure.</para>

    <title>Gallery</title>

    <para>When we click on a thumbnail for a gallery, e.g. the thumbnail with
    the white flowers for gallery Flowers in <xref
    linkend="fig_Frontend_MainPage" />, all the images in this particular
    gallery are shown. See <xref
    linkend="fig-Frontend_Gallery_Flowers" />.</para>

    <para>These thumbnails are square (setting Thumbnail Style) and there
    widht/height is (maximally) 80 pixels (setting Thumbnail Width). In this
    figure the thumnails have their title belown them (setting Show image name
    below thumbnail), the thumbnails are shown in a table (setting Thumbnail
    Style) in 3 columns (setting Number of Thumnail Columns).</para>

    <para>The thumbnails are created when images are uploaded and have the
    size and style (square/proportional) as set at the time of upload. It is
    possible to change these settings and then regenerate the thumbnails (see
    <xref linkend="sec-Maintenance" />).</para>

    <para>The searchbox is still present right above the thumbnails (setting
    Display Search).</para>

    <para>In the pathway, right above the menu About Joomla!, the galleryname
    Flowers is appended after the name of the menu item. You can go back to
    the main page via the Photos menu link or the Photos link in the
    pathway.</para>

    <para><figure xml:id="fig-Frontend_Gallery_Flowers">

    <para>You can set the maximum number of thumbnails shown in this page
    (setting Thumbnails per Page). See <xref
    linkend="fig-Frontend_Gallery_FranceEmbrun2010_Page2" />. There are 22
    images in gallery France Embrun 2010, and nine thumbnails are shown per
    page (setting Thumbnails per Page). Below the images you find the
    pagination buttons to allow you to go to each of the three pages with (up
    to) nine thumbnails.</para>

    <para>Notice the pathway where the structure of galleries is shown: via
    the menu item Photos and the gallery Hollidays the subgallery France

  <section>
    <title>Items (images)</title>

    <para>Let's go back to the Flowers gallery. Click one of the thumbnail
    images, e.g. Flowers 2011 5. <xref
    linkend="fig-Frontend_Item_Flowers_Flowers20115" /> shows the item
    page.</para>

    <para>The image shown is the display image, it is 400px wide (setting
    Display Picture Width). For a portrait image, as opposed to this landscape
    image, the height would be maximally 400px. Above this display image, the
    image title (name) is shown, and below the image is a download link
    (setting Display Downloadlink). This downloadlink allows the user to
    download the image in its original size (as long as original image is
    still on you webserver: setting Keep original image, otherwise the display
    image is used). The title, display image and downloadlink are 'sandwiched'
    between pagination links allowing the user to go to another image within
    this gallery.</para>

    <para>The display images are created when images are uploaded and have the
    size as set at the time of upload. It is possible to change these settings
    and then regenerate the display images (see <xref
    linkend="sec-Maintenance" />).</para>

    <para>At the bottom of the page there are four tabs</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Description (setting Display Description): this tab shows the
        item description when there is a description. In the description HTML
        can be used to make text bold for example or to enter a link to a
        webpage. It also show the number of hits (setting Display Hits, off by
        default, but on in the figure)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Voting (setting Display Voting): Voting needs to be enabled for
        the usergroup the user belongs to be able to vote and to see the
        voting results (see <xref linkend="sec-permissions" />). When Voting
        is enable the user can give one to five stars for an image and a user
        can only vote once (setting User van only vote once (cookie
        based)).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Comments (setting Display Comments): Comments need to be enabled
        for the usergroup the user belongs to be able to comment and to see
        the comments (see <xref linkend="sec-permissions" />). When Comments
        are enable users can enter their Name, a Title for the comment and the
        Comment text. A Captcha can be integrated in the comment form (setting
        Use CAPTCHA check, in comment form).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>EXIF (setting Display EXIF Data): a selection of EXIF Data tags
        can be shown (setting Select EXIF tags to display)</para>

    <para>At the bottom of the page, information about the RSGallery2
    component is shown (setting Display Branding) with version information and
    a link to http://www.rsgallery2.nl/.</para>

    <para>The pathway, right above the About Joomla! menu, has the image title
    added to it, just after the name of the gallery it belongs to.</para>

    <para>What happens when the users clicks on the display image depends on
    the setting Popup style in the backend, these are the options:</para>

  <section>
    <title>Slideshow</title>

    <para>On the main page there is a link to a slideshow for each gallery,
    see <xref linkend="fig_Frontend_MainPage" />. Currently (v3.1.0) there are
    two slideshows: Slideshow Parth (default) and Slideshow One (setting
    Select slideshow).</para>

    <para>The slideshow will show all items in the gallery with display
    images, not the images in subgalleries.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Slideshow Parth</title>

      <para>Slideshow parth has a number of settings (see <xref
      linkend="sec-SlideshowParth_settings" />) and looks by default like
      <xref linkend="fig-Frontend_SlideshowParth_imageInfopaneNoCaroussel" />
      and <xref
      linkend="fig-Frontend_SlideshowParth_imageNoInfopaneCaroussel" />. In
      the first figure you can see the Infopane at the bottom, the arrows at
      the left and right to allow the user to go to the previous and next
      image and at the top there is at tab with the text "Thumbnails" that
      opens a carousel with small images.</para>

  <section>
    <title>My Galleries</title>

    <para>A site administrator can enable My Galleries (setting Show My
    Galleries, 'no' by default). When a user logs in in the frontend the main
    page wil then show an extra link: My galleries, right above the searchbox.
    Clicking on that link will show a page like in <xref
    linkend="fig-Frontend_MyGalleries_noPermissions" /> or in <xref
    linkend="fig-Frontend_MyGalleries_allPermissions" />.</para>

    <para><figure xml:id="fig-Frontend_MyGalleries_noPermissions">
        <title>My Galleries page for a user without any permissions</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure></para>

    <para>The differences in these two figures arise from the different
    permissions a user can have (see <xref linkend="sec-permissions" />), e.g.
    Edit Permission, Edit State Permission (to publish or unpublish an item or
    gallery), Delete Permission and Create Permission for items and
    galleries.</para>

    <para>A user with none of these permissions can only see the items and
    galleries, but cannot publish, delete, edit or create items or galleries.
    That is reflected on the tabs My Images and My galleries by the grey icons
    for the items and galleries. That user will also not see the Add Image and
    Create Gallery tabs.</para>

    <para>However, when a user has all permissions, the icons are no longer
    greyed out, and there are two more tabs: Add Image and Create
    Gallery.</para>

    <para>A site administrator can choose to give only specific permissions to
    a usergroup, e.g. only Edit permission, and only give that permission for
    a specific gallery. Then the user will see from the icons being grey (and
    non-functional) or not if they have that permission.</para>

    <para>At the top of the page there is a box with User information: the
    username of the user who is currently logged in, the number of galleries
    this user has already created and its allowed maximum (setting Maximum
    number of galleries a user can have) and the number of items for which the
    user is the owner and its allowed maximum (setting Max numbers of pictures
    a user can have).</para>

    <para>We will assume for the following sections that the user has all
    permissions for all galleries and items and that My Galleries are
    enabled.</para>

      <para>Go to My Galleries via the menu item Photos and then My galleries.
      You are now on the My galleries page.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Create a gallery</title>

        <para>On the My galleries page click the Create Gallery tab. This tab
        only shows when the user that is logged in has Create permission. To
        create a new gallery, first choose its parent (choose Top gallery when
        you want the gallery to be on the same 'level' as e.g. the gallery
        Cakes, or choose an existing gallery, like gallery Cakes, for that to
        be the parent. Then give the a name and a description and click the
        little disk button at the top right of the Create Gallery tab. See
        <xref linkend="fig-Frontend_MyGalleries_CreateGallery" />. Next to the
        disk button is a red round button with a white cross inside: this is
        the cancel button that will clear all fields.</para>

        <para>Saving the gallery details returns you to this page and this
        tab, but with the extra gallery created (note: this gallery is
        unpublished by default). Unless of course the user already is at its
        maximum allowed galleries, then the gallery will not be
        created.</para>

        the gallery is published (green icon with white checkmark) or
        unpublished (red icon with white dot inside). When the user is not
        allowed to change the state, the icons are grey, but with either the

      <para>Go to My Galleries via the menu item Photos and then My galleries.
      You are now on the My galleries page.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Create an item (e.g. upload one or more images)</title>

        <para>On the My galleries page click the Add Image tab. This tab only
        shows when the user that is logged in has Create permission for one or
        more galleries. You can either add a single image, or a set of images
        in a zipfile.</para>

        <para>To add your image(s), first choose the gallery that will hold
        the image(s). Browse to the file to select it and give the item a
        title and a description. In case of multiple images in a zipfile, this
        title and description will be used for each image. To upload your
        image(s) and save the details, click the disk button at the top right
        of the Create Gallery tab. See <xref
        linkend="fig-Frontend_MyGalleries_AddItem" />. Next to the disk button
        is a red round button with a white cross inside: this is the cancel
        button that will clear all fields.</para>

        <para>Saving the item returns you to this page and this tab, but with
        the extra image(s) created (note: the newly uploaded image will be
        unpublished by default). Unless of course the user already is at its
        maximum allowed item, then the items will not be created.</para>

        <title>Change the state of a item: published or unpublished</title>

        <para>On the My galleries page click the My Images tab (<xref
        linkend="fig-Frontend_MyGalleries_MyImages" />). This shows a list of
        galleries. In the Published column the user can tell by the icon if
        the gallery is published (green icon with white checkmark) or
        unpublished (red icon with white dot inside). When the user is not
        allowed to change the state, the icons are grey, but with either the
        checkmark or the dot.</para>

        <para>A click on the icon toggles the state from unpublished to
        published and vice versa.</para>

        <title>Edit an item</title>

        <para>The details like the title and description of the image can be
        edited and a different gallery to which the item belongs to can be
        chosen. The item can be edited by clicking on its Edit icon (see <xref
        linkend="fig-Frontend_MyGalleries_MyImages" />). Doing this shows a
        new window with the item details (<xref
        linkend="fig-Frontend_MyGalleries_EditImage" />). You can save your
        changes by clicking the disk-icon on the top right, or you can cancel
        your changes by clicking the red round icon with the wtithe cross
        inside. Both save and cancel will take you back to the My Galleries
        page.</para>
