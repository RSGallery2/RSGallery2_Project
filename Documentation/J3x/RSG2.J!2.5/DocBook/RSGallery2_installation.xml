      <para>On RSGallery2's homepage, <link
      xlink:href="www.rsgallery2.nl">www.rsgallery2.nl</link>, there is a link
      to the latest release of RSGallery2. Each release shows a version number
      and on which version of Joomla! it can be used.</para>

      <para>Older versions are available on <link
      xlink:href="http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/rsgallery2/frs/">JoomlaCode</link>
      where you'll see the available releases when you click the Package
      "RSGallery2". The release name will be something like <tag
      class="attribute">RSGallery2_2.1.1_J15</tag> which tells you it is
      version 2.1.1 and intended for Joomla! 1.5 whereas <tag
      class="attribute">RSGallery2_3.0.1_J16J17</tag> is version 3.0.1 and

      <title>Installing RSGallery2</title>

      <para>RSGallery2 is installed as any other Joomla! extension. First you
      have to log in to the Administrator section, also called Backend. Click
      on Extensions &gt; Extension Manager (see <xref
      linkend="fig-extension-manager-install" />). Then click the Browse
      button and find and select the downloaded package file. Back on the
      Extension Manager page you'll see that the path to your selected package
      file is shown in Package File. Now click Upload &amp; Install.</para>

      <title>Updating RSGallery2</title>

      <para>Updating RSGallery2 to the latest version is no different than
      installing RSGallery2 for the first time. Either visit RSGallery2's
      homepage, <link xlink:href="www.rsgallery2.nl">www.rsgallery2.nl</link>,
      or the download section on <link
      xlink:href="http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/rsgallery2/frs/">JoomlaCode</link>
      to find out what the latest version is. If there is a new release, for
      the Joomla! version you are using, download it and install as indicated
      in <xref linkend="sec-installing-rsgallery2" />.</para>

      <important>
        <para>Always keep a recent backup of your site! See <link
        xlink:href="http://docs.joomla.org/Backup">http://docs.joomla.org/Backup</link>.</para>
      </important>

      <para>Upon successfull update of RSGallery2 you will see some messages,
      e.g. telling you what version you updated from and what version you
      updated to (see <xref linkend="fig-Successfull-update" />). If there is
      something you should know it will be posted with these messages.</para>

      <figure xml:id="fig-Successfull-update">
        <title>Update of RSGallery2 from 3.0.2 to 3.1.0 was
        successfull.</title>

    <section>
      <title>First steps after installation</title>

      <para>After you have installed you will want to make one or more
      galleries first. See <xref linkend="sec-create-a-gallery" /> on how to
      create a gallery. Then you can upload one or more images. See <xref
      linkend="sec-upload-single-item" /> on how to upload a single image and
      <xref linkend="sec-upload-batch" /> on how to upload a batch of images.
      Then you will have to create a menu item linking to RSGallery2 for your
      frontend users to see your gallery/galleries with your uploaded images.
      See <xref linkend="sec-create-RSGalelry2-menu-item" /> on how to create
      a menu item linking to your gallery/galleries. This will get you going
      and start learning how RSGallery2 works.</para>

      <para>After you have done this you will probably see some things you
      want to adapt to your wishes. See <xref
      linkend="sec-Configuration-Settings" /> about the RSGallery2
      Configuration options.</para>
