  <title>Backend</title>

  <para>In the Backend, accessed via e.g.
  http://www.rsgallery2.nl/administrator/, you can manage your galleries,
  images and change the configuration settings for RSGallery2. You will find
  that RSGallery2 works very similar to the way you would make categories in
  Joomla (galleries in RSGallery2) or articles in Joomla (items, or images in
  RSGallery2). We will assume that you are logged in in your Backend of your
  Joomla site as a Super Administrator and as such have all the permissions a
  user can have.</para>

  <para>First we will create a few galleries and upload some images (refered
  to as items here). Then a menu-item is created so our frontend users can see
  our galleries. Finally the Configuration settings are discussed as well as
  Permissions settings.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Galleries</title>

    <para>Before you start creating galleries it's always a good idea to take
    a moment to think about the structure of galleries. Galleries can be
    nested, just like Joomla categories can be nested. See <xref
    linkend="sec-example-galleries" /> for an example.</para>

    <section xml:id="sec-create-a-gallery">
      <title>Create a gallery</title>

      <para>To create a gallery (users need to have Create permission) go to
      Manage Galleries: Backend &gt; Components &gt; RSGallery2 &gt; Galleries
      (see <xref linkend="fig-manage-galleries-screen" />) and click New. You
      will see the screen shown in <xref
      linkend="fig-fig-Backend_New_Gallery" />.</para>

          <para>Alias: you can leave this empty and Joomla will create an

          can enter an alias yourself. The alias is used in <link
          xlink:href="http://docs.joomla.org/Search_Engine_Friendly_URLs">Search
          Engine Friendly URLs</link>, so the only characters allowed are

          either <emphasis>u</emphasis> (dutch) or <emphasis>ue</emphasis>
          (german), based on the transliteration of the language used).
          <footnote>
              <para>Transliteration is handled by the language pack that you

      <title>Change the order of galleries</title>

      <para>Changing the order of the galleries is easiest in the Manage
      Galleries screen shown in <xref
      linkend="fig-Backend_Manage_Galleries_five_galleries_not_ordered" />,
      this works just like changing the order for Joomla Categories. A user
      needs Edit State permission to be allowed to change the order.</para>

      <!--Edit State permission: core.edit.state-->

      <para>Go to the Manage Galleries screen via Backend &gt; Components &gt;
      RSGallery2 &gt; Galleries. There are two ways to change the
      order:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>In the Reorder column you can click the blue and white up and
          down icons to move each gallery individually (these icons are not
          shown for users without Edit State permission).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>In the Order column you can change the numbers (but only when
          you have Edit State permission) and click the little Save Order
          floppy disk icon next to the Order text.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Change the state of the gallery: published or unpublished</title>

      <para>The state of the gallery, published or unpublished, can be changed
      by users with Edit State permission. Changing the state of the galleries
      is easiest in the Manage Galleries screen shown in <xref
      linkend="fig-Backend_Manage_Galleries_five_galleries_not_ordered" />.
      All galleries shown in this image are published: there is a green icon
      with a white checkmark in the column Published. Unpublished galleries
      would have a red icon with a white dot inside. This works the same as in
      the rest of Joomla.</para>

      <para>Go to the Manage Galleries screen via Backend &gt; Components &gt;
      RSGallery2 &gt; Galleries. There are two ways to change the
      state:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Click the icon in the Published column to change the state
          from Published (green icon with with checkmark) to Unpublished (red
          icon with white dot) and vice versa.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Select one or more galleries by checking the checkboxes at the
          left of the gallery name and click the Publish or Unpublish icon in
          the toolbar at the top of the page.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Edit a gallery</title>

      <para>You can edit the details for a saved gallery if you have Edit
      permission or Edit Own permission and you are the owner of the gallery.
      In the Manage Galleries screen (go there via Backend &gt; Components
      &gt; RSGallery2 &gt; Galleries), either click on the gallery name, or
      check the checkbox left to the gallery name and click Edit. You can
      easily tell which galleries you are allowed to edit, because their names
      are links to the Edit Gallery screen.</para>

      <!--Edit permission: core.edit
Edit Own permission: core.edit.own
-->

      <para>The Edit Gallery screen is almost the same as the New Gallery
      screen (<xref linkend="fig-fig-Backend_New_Gallery" />), so refer to
      <xref linkend="sec-create-a-gallery" /> for a descriptions of the
      settings.</para>

      <para>We edit the gallery "Switzerland 200" that has a typo to change
      its name to "Switzerland 2009".</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Delete a gallery</title>

      <para>Deleting a galley is a two step proces, you will be asked to
      confirm the deletion in the second step. When a gallery is deleted, its
      items (images) and subgalleries will be deleted as well. Users need
      Delete permission to be able to delete a gallery.</para>

      <para>A gallery can be deleted via the Manage Galleries screen (go there
      via Backend &gt; Components &gt; RSGallery2 &gt; Galleries), check the
      checkbox left to the gallery or galleries you want to delete and click
      Delete. When you're sure you want to delete the selected galleries and
      their items (images) and subgalleries click Confirm Removal.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Items (images)</title>

    <para>Galleries contain items, for most users these items will be images
    with e.g. a title and description, we'll mix the usages of the words image
    and item.<footnote>
        <para>RSGallery2 has also some capabilities for video and MP3 files,
        however, these capabilities are not discussed here and this function
        is currently '<emphasis>as-is</emphasis>' and is not being
        developed.</para>
      </footnote></para>

    <para>The types of images that can be uploaded are jpg, jpeg, gif and png
    images.</para>

    <!--Create permissin: core.create-->

    <section>
      <title>Create items</title>

      <para>An RSGallery2 item is created when you upload an image. Users need
      Create permission for a specific gallery to be able to upload images to
      that gallery. You can either upload up to ten single images via Upload
      or upload a batch of files via an archive (e.g. zip file) or via FTP.
      Both are explained in the next sections.</para>

      <section xml:id="sec-upload-single-item">
        <title>Upload</title>

        <para>We'll start with uploading a few images via Upload: Backend &gt;

          <listitem>
            <para>Per image you can optionally give a title. If no title is

                <para>Zip file (archive): browse to an archive file (e.g. zip
                file) and select it. Note: The size that such an archive file
                can have is not only determined by the upload limit set on
                your website, but also on time out limits. If an archive fails
                to upload either try a smaller archive file, or use the FTP
                method.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>FTP: You will have to upload the images by FTP yourself
                to a location within your webroot. The location of the webroot
                is indicated on the screen. You can create, for example, a
                directory <tag class="attribute">/tempupload/</tag> in your
                webroot and put the full path to this directory here. For
                windows users who use Xampp (webaddress
                http://localhost/joomla25/) this may become <tag
                class="attribute">C:\xampp\htdocs\rsgallery2\tempupload\</tag>

      <para>Changing the order of the galleries is easiest in the Manage Items
      screen shown in <xref linkend="fig-Backend_Manage_Items_with_items" />,
      this works just like changing the order for Galleries. A user needs Edit
      State permission to be allowed to change the order.</para>

      <para>Go to the Manage Items screen via: Backend &gt; Components &gt;

          <listitem>
            <para>In the Reorder column you can click the blue and white up
            and down icons to move each gallery individually (these icons are
            not shown for users without Edit State permission).</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>In the Order column you can change the numbers (but only

      <title>Change the state of the item: published or unpublished</title>

      <para>The state of an item, published or unpublished, can be changed by
      users with Edit State permission. Changing the state of an item is
      easiest in the Manage Items screen shown in <xref
      linkend="fig-Backend_Manage_Items_with_items" />. All items shown in
      this image are published: there is a green icon with a white checkmark
      in the column Published. Unpublished galleries would have a red icon
      with a white dot inside. This works the same as in the rest of
      Joomla.</para>

      <para>Go to the Manage Items screen via Backend &gt; Components &gt;
      RSGallery2 &gt; Items. There are two ways to change the state:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Click the icon in the Published column to change the state
          from Published (green icon with with checkmark) to Unpublished (red
          icon with white dot) and vice versa.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Select one or more galleries by checking the checkboxes at the

      <para>You can edit the details for a saved item if you either have Edit
      permission or you have Edit Own permission and you are the owner of the
      item. In the Manage Item screen (go there via Backend &gt; Components
      &gt; RSGallery2 &gt; Items), either click on the item name, or check the
      checkbox left to the item name and click Edit. You can easily tell which
      galleries you are allowed to edit, because their names are links to the
      Edit Gallery screen.</para>

      <!--Edit permission: core.edit
Edit Own permission: core.edit.own

      <para>The Edit Gallery screen shows these settings:</para>

      <para><itemizedlist>

            <para>Name: sets the name of your item, it is a required
            field.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Alias: you can leave this empty and Joomla will create an
            alias based on the Name you entered when you save the item or you
            can enter an alias yourself. The alias is used in <link
            xlink:href="http://docs.joomla.org/Search_Engine_Friendly_URLs">Search
            Engine Friendly URLs</link>, so the only characters allowed are

            xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic">diacritic</link>
            will automatically be converted (e.g. <emphasis>ü</emphasis> to
            either <emphasis>u</emphasis> (dutch) or <emphasis>ue</emphasis>
            (german), based on the transliteration of the language used).
            <footnote>
                <para>Transliteration is handled by the language pack that you

    of galleries you can also make a menu item with the type Slideshow view
    instead of View of galleries. This will give your frontend user a menu
    item showing a slideshow for a specific gallery. Here you cannot choose
