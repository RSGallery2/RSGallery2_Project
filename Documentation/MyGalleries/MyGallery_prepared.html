(1) Search for RSGallery2 in System-&gt;Global configuration
(2) Select Permissions (3)-(6) Activate the "Create own", "Delete own", "Edit own", "Edit state own" permissions.
The "vote" or "comment" permissions enable actions on the images itself. They are not needed for the handling of galleries and images.
Edit Permission, Edit State Permission (to publish or unpublish an item or gallery),
Delete Permission and Create Permission for items and galleries.
A user with none of these permissions can only see the items and galleries,
but cannot publish, delete, edit or create items or galleries.
That is reflected on the tabs My Images and My galleries by the grey icons for the items and galleries.
That user will also not see the Add Image and Create Gallery tabs.
However, when a user has all permissions, the icons are no longer greyed out, and there are two more tabs: Add Image and Create Gallery.
A site administrator can choose to give only specific permissions to a user group, e.g. only Edit permission, and only give that permission for a specific gallery.
Then the user will see from the icons being grey (and non-functional) or not if they have that permission.</p>

    <p>Frontend 12: We will assume for the following sections that the user has all permissions for all galleries and items and that My Galleries are enabled.

    <p>This tab only shows when the user that is logged in has Create permission.
To create a new gallery, first choose its parent (choose Top gallery when you want the gallery to be on the same 'level' as e.g. the gallery Cakes,
or choose an existing gallery, like gallery Cakes, for that to be the parent.
Then give the a name and a description and click the little disk button at the top right of the Create Gallery tab.
See Figure 2.10, “My Galleries: tab Create Gallery”~~ ~~
[13]. Next to the disk button is a red round button with a white cross inside: this is the cancel button that will clear all fields.
Saving the gallery details returns you to this page and this tab, but with the extra gallery created (note: this gallery is unpublished by default).
Unless of course the user already is at its maximum allowed galleries, then the gallery will not be created.

When the user is not allowed to change the state, the icons are grey, but with either the checkmark or the dot.
A click on the icon toggles the state from unpublished to published and vice versa. Figure 2.11. My galleries: tab My galleries~~</p>

    <p>This tab only shows when the user that is logged in has Create permission for one or more galleries.
You can either add a single image, or a set of images in a zipfile. To add your image(s), first choose the gallery that will hold the image(s).
Browse to the file to select it and give the item a title and a description. In case of multiple images in a zipfile, this title and description will be used for each image.
To upload your image(s) and save the details, click the disk button at the top right of the Create Gallery tab. See Figure 2.13, “My galleries: Add images”
[15]. Next to the disk button is a red round button with a white cross inside: this is the cancel button that will clear all fields.
