## My Galleries
A site administrator can enable My Galleries for users to upload and view their own galleries (setting Show My  Galleries, 'no' by default). A extra element will appear on the gallery view when a user has logged in on the front end.

![My Gallery: Standard "My gallery" view ](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/Images/MyGallery.External.view.png?raw=true)

View of user created "My Gallery" gallery

The "my galleries" are viewed on the module where the menu with type RSGallery2 is displayed.
Above the RSGallery2 "Search box" the user can click on "My galleries" link (3)

![Link to "My Galleries" ](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/Images/MyGallery.FirstLink.png?raw=true)

(Link must be activated in configuration of RSG2)

Clicking on that link will show a page like

![First my Galleries user view ](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/Images/MyGallery.FirstUserView.png?raw=true)
If tab (1) does not appear the user has not enough rights
