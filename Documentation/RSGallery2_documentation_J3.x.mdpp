# RSGallery2 Documentation

## <center>RSGallery2 Team</center>

<center>Version 2019.05.05</center><br>

This is just a collection of all written documentation for the RSGallery2 web page. We are sorry for the ugly style. It results from the limitation of writing in fast "Markdown syntax".
We hope that at least you have all needed information in one document and you don't have to scan through all online documents
to find what you need.

This is a work in progress and will be updated regularly.
Sadly some bits and pieces are missing.

With each new development we try to update the documentation of this part more or less immediately.
There are many places where we can continue our work and sometimes we have to decide, develop or document.

Here we are more likely to publish than to be stylish and polished.
