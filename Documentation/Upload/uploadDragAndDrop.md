## Upload files using drag and drop
(1) Specify gallery
First select an existing gallery

(2) Drag and drop area
The drag and drop area is marked with a red or green dotted border. The color changes to green when a gallery is selected. An error message appears when a image is dropped while the border is red.
When images are dropped then they are transferred to the server and assigned to the gallery. Display, thumb and watermarked images are created and on success the image is displayed in the drag and drop area.
