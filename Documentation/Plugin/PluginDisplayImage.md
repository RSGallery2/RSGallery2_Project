RSGallery2 Display Image plugin (Single Display)
This plugin will replace {rsg2_singledisplay: imageid, size, caption, format, clearfloat} in articles with the corresponding RSGallery2 image.

* imageid: Backend > Components > RSGallery2 > Items: use the number from the ID column (required).
* size: thumb, display or original (optional, default is display).
* caption: true (use the item desciption as a caption) or false (no caption) (optional, default is false
* format: text-align style property (optional)
* clearfloat: both, left, right or false: When not set to false this inserts a div CSS element after the image with clear property both, left or right (optional, default is false)


When the given image id does not exist, or the image or gallery is unpublished, the plugin will show nothing unless the option Debug is turned on. When the user is not allowed to access the gallery where the item belongs to, nothing will show unless the options Debug is turned on.

Examples:
* {rsg2_singledisplay:9999,thumb,true,left;float:left, left}
* {rsg2_singledisplay:2,display,false,right, float:right, both}
* {rsg2_singledisplay:42}.
