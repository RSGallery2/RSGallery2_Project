    <p>RSGallery2 plugin to automatically create a personal gallery for each "new" user that is created.
For web pages which want to support Rsgallery2 function "My Galleries".</p>
    <p>When a new user registers, this plugin (when enabled) will create a new RSGallery2 gallery for that new user and owned by that new user, based on the settings in the plugin parameters</p>
    <p>When my galleries is activated in the RSGallery2 configuration then the user owned galleries will be shown on the site.</p>
    <p>The user needs permissions</p>
    <ul>
      <li>'edit own' and</li>
      <li>'edit 'state own'</li>
      <li>'delete own',</li>
      <li>('create own'),
to upload/release and delete images in owned gallery.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>'Create own' allows to add more galleries to the owned ones.</p>
    <p>Tip: Create a own user group for "myGallery" user and assign it for new users automatically.
A new user default group can be selected in  Backend &gt; Users &gt; User Manager &gt; Options &gt; Tab: User Options &gt; Setting: New User Registration Group. Here select the created new user group.</p>
    <p>Install the plugin, <em>enable the plugin</em>, check the plugin settings and add a new user (try from frontend and backend).</p>
