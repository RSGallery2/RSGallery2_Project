# Installation

## 1\. Download the main RSGallery2 component

On github look for the newest version (v4.2.0++) [Releases of component](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Component/releases)

Inside the assets you will find a zip file with a name like **RSGallery2_Component_4_2_0.zip**. Download and install the newest zip file matching this name and a newer version number

## **2\. Install RSGallery2 component**

RSGallery2 is installed like all other Joomla! extensions. Log in to the Administrator section, click on Extensions > Manage ->Install

![Extension install  component view](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/Joomla.Extensions.Install.png?raw=true)

(1) Select "upload package file" tab
(2) Drag and drop the downloaded zip file into the drop area

On successful upload you will get a message similar to following image

![RSGalllery2 component updated](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Project/blob/master/Documentation/J3x/ImagesUsedInDoc/Joomla.Extensions.IsInstalled.png?raw=true)

On upload error try to transfer (?the content of?) the zip file to the server and use "Install from folder". (Some php.ini settings restrict the size of uploaded files)

Clicking on (1) will lead to the RSGallery2 control panel
