
Finding the issues and PR tagged with Documentation Required is the easy part.

I think the key task needing to be done is for some work to be performed on:
Looking at every item tagged "Documentation Required"
Checking if it's been added to/updated in JDocs
If not - create an appropriate "Red Link" page (something that needs a page, but for which a page doesn't exist yet) to create a placeholder for someone to then write the documentation.
Log the link to JDocs Red Link back to the GitHub issue to allow someone to follow up and write the article.
