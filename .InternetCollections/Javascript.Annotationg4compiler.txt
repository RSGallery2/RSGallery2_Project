Annotating JavaScript for the Closure Compiler

Overview

(copied from https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler, included in the GitHub wiki to permit community editing)
The Closure Compiler can use data type information about JavaScript variables to provide enhanced optimization and warnings. JavaScript, however, has no way to declare types.

Because JavaScript has no syntax for declaring the type of a variable, you must use comments in the code to specify the data type.

The Closure Compiler's type language derives from the annotations used by the JSDoc document-generation tool. This document describes the set of annotations and type expressions that the Closure Compiler understands.
