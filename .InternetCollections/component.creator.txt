I have something similar (bit more further developed), 
on the other side we have jorobo which is the 
"offical" joomla robo.li tool kit to package extensions,
 @Hannes Papenberg would like to extend it so it can create 
 extensions like your tool (and my tool and 10 other tools) 
 are already doing. combine this energy could make sense...
