getReorderConditions() method is used in reorder() method of JModelAdmin class to apply additional conditions to reorder query.

If I understood you correctly you should add getReorderConditions() method to your Group model:

/**
 * A protected method to get a set of ordering conditions.
 *
 * @param   object  $table A record object.
 *
 * @return  array   An array of conditions to add to add to ordering queries.
 */
protected function getReorderConditions($table)
{
    $condition = array();
    $condition[] = 'catid = ' . (int) $table->catid;

    return $condition;
}
catid is the category field in your table.
