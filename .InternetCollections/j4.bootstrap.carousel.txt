Using bootstrap.carousel

depends on how you want to use carousel. If you use it with default 
options value, use webasset would be better. But if you want to 
pass custom value for carousel options, use HTMLHelper would be 
better because it saves you from having to write many codes to 
pass these options to the carousel script 

https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/blob/4.2-dev/libraries/src/HTML/Helpers/Bootstrap.php#L142-L152

----------------------------------------
use Joomla\CMS\HTML\HTMLHelper;
HTMLHelper::_('bootstrap.carousel', '.selector');

Carousel
Assuming you have the HTML part already in your Layout, you will also need to include the interactivity (the javascript part):

\Joomla\CMS\HTML\HTMLHelper::_('bootstrap.carousel', '.selector', []);
The .selector refers to the CSS selector for the carousel. You can call this function multiple times with different CSS selectors
The third argument refers to the options available for carousel
Options for the carousel can be:

interval, number, default:5000, The amount of time to delay between automatically cycling an item. If false, carousel will not automatically cycle.
keyboard, boolean, default:true Whether the carousel should react to keyboard events.
pause, string|boolean, hover Pauses the cycling of the carousel on mouseenter and resumes the cycling of the carousel on mouseleave.
slide, string|boolean, default:false Autoplays the carousel after the user manually cycles the first item. If "carousel", autoplays the carousel on load.

Coders
Load what you need per case! There are helper functions to set up individual components with appropriate arguments.
See the list of Bootstrap Interactive Components.

PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Don't use HTMLHelper::_('bootstrap.framework');!
