[4.2] - Admin login - set max width on image by travisrisner · Pull Request #39766 · joomla/joomla-cms · GitHub


max-width solves the problem for images that are too wide 
for the login module. If your logo is portrait or square 
and maybe not so wide then the max-width has no effect, 
but the max-height and the image looks distorted. Normally 
it should be max-width:100% in combination with height:auto 
or width: auto and max-height: 4.4rem to allow the image 
to resize correctly.


I think, in the case of the logo for the login module, 
the height of the image is more important than the width. 
Imagine if someone puts a 800px high image, the login will 
looks very weird and you will need to scroll to be able to 
enter your credentials.
IMHO is max-height: 4.4rem and width: auto the better 
solution... but that should be tested with different 
kind of logos. 

Not sure if object-fit would help here somehow.

I was thinking about that too, but in this case you want 
to display the full logo, object-fit will crop the image...

Fix works, but can I suggest a slightly different 
approach? 4.4em is tiny for a lot of logos.

What about something like:

max-height: 15rem;
max-width: 100%;
object-fit: contain;
