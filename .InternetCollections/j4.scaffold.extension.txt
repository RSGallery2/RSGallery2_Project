
jorobo doesn't create components,
 it's for packaging and maintaining the component, 
 dgrammatiko project creates a component

Jrobo
https://github.com/joomla-projects/jorobo

	
dgrammatiko

So I published something on npm that might be useful:
Scaffold any component/plugin/module/template/library with essentially one command.
navigate your terminal inside an empty folder then run

npm create @dgrammatiko/joomla-extension
Then install the npm pkgs: npm install
Then initialise the dev environment with npm run init
link the subfolder www to your server (symbolic link) and voila
