

please never add logic to getEventListners(); even if it looks 
like a good idea it isn't supposed to used like that.
remove the $allowLegacyListeners = true convert everyone to 
event subscriber. Didn't know till now that it exists. Please 
be consistent with current techniques on refactoring or 
creating new extensions.
The plugin has a $app which should be injected in the provider.
New plugins return always void and use $event->setResult(); 
or $event->setArgument(); to set values
about the problem it self, can you please add stacktraces to 
each variant in the called event.
