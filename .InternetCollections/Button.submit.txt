... in different controllers based on the value of the 
HTTP parameter task. This parameter is set by Joomla 
core javascript based on the submit button, eg in 
the example below:

onclick="Joomla.submitbutton('myform.submit')"

The task parameter is in this example set to "myform.submit". 
In general the task parameter is of the 
form "firstpart.secondpart" and for a component 
called "com_example" Joomla will try to run an 
instance method called secondpart() of a controller 
class ExampleControllerFirstpart in a file 
firstpart.php in the controllers directory.

If the task parameter is not set then Joomla will 
try to run the display() method of the 
ExampleController class which it will expect 
to find in controller.php.
