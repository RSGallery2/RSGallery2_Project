sql name and names quoting and sting and string quoting

A simple rule for us to remember what to use in which case:

[S]ingle quotes are for [S]trings Literals (date literals are also strings);
[D]ouble quotes are for [D]atabase Identifiers;
Examples:

INSERT INTO "USERS" ("LOGIN", "PASSWORD", "DT_BIRTH") VALUES ('EDUARDO', '12345678', '1980-09-06');

In MySQL and MariaDB, the ` (backtick) symbol is the same as the " symbol. 

---------------------------------

I use this mnemonic:

Single quotes are for strings (one thing)
Double quotes are for tables names and column names (two things)
This is not 100% correct according to the specs, but this mnemonic helps me (human being).
