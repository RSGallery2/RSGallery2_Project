
quoteName(): Table names and table column names
quote(): Field values and use type 

--------------------------
Joomla's PHP Coding Standards say:

Table names and table column names should always 
be enclosed in the quoteName() method to escape 
the table name and table columns. Field values 
checked in a query should always be enclosed in 
the quote() method to escape the value before 
passing it to the database. Integer field values 
checked in a query should also be type cast to (int).

-------------------------------------------
Toeing this line too often results in ugly 
and bloated code, while unnecessarily calling 
quoting methods.

Because none of the table or column names 
actually need quoting, and you should cast 
integer variables as integer type before 
writing them into the query, this is what 
I would recommend...

*note value is a MySQL keyword, but not a 
Reserved Keyword, so it doesn't require 
backticking.

$db = JFactory::getDbo();
$query = $db->getQuery(true)
    ->select("value")
    ->from("#__rsticketspro_custom_fields_values")
    ->where([
        "ticket_id = " . (int)$item->id,
        "custom_field_id = 4"
    ]);
$db->setQuery($query);
$result = $db->loadResult();

* the WHERE clause is happy to receive an array 
of conditions

* method chaining can start from the getQuery() 
  method to avoid writing $query at the start of each line

* there is no point in quoting or casting the 
  static value 4
