Use images

A new JLayout[^gist.github.com/dgrammatiko/a20236039586a2fbc5c77caadffc3de8] as of Joomla 4.0.5 allows developers to output HTML image tags easily:

 

So instead of writing something like this:

 

``PHP

 

'; ?>

The recommended way is to use the JLayout:

``PHP

<?php

echo LayoutHelper::render('joomla.html.image', ['src' => imageURL, 'alt' => $imageAlt]);

?>

Advantages:

 

The URL and the alt attribute are escaped correctly.

The developer does not have to worry about the "#" at the end of the URL.

The image tag gets a loading="lazy" attribute if the image has the width and height attributes defined.

The alt attribute is ignored if the value passed is false.

All other attributes are rendered correctly, pass them as in the array (for example 'class' => 'my-class').
