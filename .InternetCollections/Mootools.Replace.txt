check where it is loaded and remove calls:

Loading MooTools on all pages
You can add the following code to the index.php file of your template 
to load MooTools throughout the site, the code must be inside <?php ?> tags.
To load just the MooTools Core library use:

JHtml::_('behavior.framework');

Or to load both the Core and More libraries:

JHtml::_('behavior.framework', true);

Loading MooTools in a form page
To load MooTools only in pages where a form is used include the same 
code in a Custom Code action in the form ON Load event:

<?php
JHtml::_('behavior.framework', true);
?>


??? JHtml::_('behavior.caption');

Insert this into your index.php (in the <head> section):
This should remove all the Joomla javascripts that are there by default 
(caption.js, mootools-core.js, core.js). In addition it also removes mootools-more.js

Code: 
<?php
$search = array('mootools', 'caption.js','core.js');
// remove the js files
foreach($this->_scripts as $key => $script) {
   foreach($search as $findme) {
      if(stristr($key, $findme) !== false) {
         unset($this->_scripts[$key]);
      }
   }
}

code
01. // Remove mootools front end
02. $user =& JFactory::getUser();
03. if($user->get('guest') == 1) {
04.    $search = array('mootools', 'caption.js', 'validate.js');
05.    // remove the js files
06.    foreach($this->_scripts as $key => $script) {
07.       foreach($search as $findme) {
08.           if(stristr($key, $findme) !== false) {
09.               unset($this->_scripts[$key]);
10.           }
11.       } 
12.    }
13. }

Method #1: Delete the mootools files
This method simply consists of deleting (through FTP) the mootools files that 
are included by Joomla. The mootools files to be deleted are the following:
The mootools-core.js JavaScript file which is located under the /media/system/js directory.
The core.js JavaScript file which is also located under the media/system/js directory.
The main advantages of this method is that it’s super fast, but on the flip side, 
you will be deleting a core Joomla file that you may need later!


Method #2: Comment out the inclusion of mootools in Joomla’s core
As mentioned earlier, the mootools JavaScript library is included in the file 
behavior.php which is located under the /libraries/joomla/html/html directory. 
So, to comment out the inclusion of mootools, all you need to do is to comment 
out the following lines (lines 60-61) in the aforementioned file:

JHtml::_('script', 'system/mootools-' . $type . '.js', false, true, false, false, $debug);
JHtml::_('script', 'system/core.js', false, true);
This method is better than the first one because we are only commenting the 
inclusion of the files, and not deleting the files. The downside of this method, 
however, is that we are changing a core file (behavior.php). At itoctopus, 
changing core files is always a last resort option when everything else fails!

Method #3: Develop a system plugin that will unload mootools
In our opinion, developing a system plugin that will unload the mootools library 
is the best option (and it’s what we do). This is because you won’t be deleting 
any file and you won’t be changing a core Joomla file. Additionally, this whole 
thing (disabling mootools) can just be reversed/applied by just 
disabling/enabling the plugin!
