There is no class to replace it. JObject is a historic class which isn't 
really needed anymore with current PHP versions.
The error handling should instead be done using exceptions. 
Other than that it only contains some setter and getter methods. 
Either create own set/get methods in your class or use for example 
our Registry class if you need more advanced property handling.
