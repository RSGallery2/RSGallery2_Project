
Does anyone have experience with implementing frontend drag and drop reordering?
I have setup a frontend list view and set the $saveOrderingUrl and added HTMLHelper::_('draggablelist.draggable');
I can pickup a row in the table but cannot drop it on another position. When I try to drop the row into its new position, I see in the console the the following error: 


2:49 PM

I have no clue what goes wrong. But because of the error the saveOrderAjax isn't called.

Extremely important that the tbody element has all the data that the draggula needs, check: https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/blob/5cdef837c9763a711cecdf5a8929622dc4c4b8e4/administrator/components/com_content/tmpl/articles/default.php#L150C31-L152C41

Yes, tbody has that:

<tbody class="js-draggable" data-url="index.php?option=com_cglegent&task=fdgroups.saveOrderAjax&tmpl=component&fcaa800b1e2523cf233fe90c43cc44ad=1" data-direction="asc">

can you enable debug so the stack could be more readable and repost the error stack?

Enable javascript debug you mean?

no, enable the debug in the Joomla global settings, then try to recreate the error again in the url that fails and capture a screen shot of the error stack

I will try that

When I select a row to drag I can drag the row, but not drop it into a new position. No error is displayed in the debug module at the bottom. Only error I see is in the Javascript console.

You also need a group id on each < tr> element: https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/blob/5cdef837c9763a711cecdf5a8929622dc4c4b8e4/administrator/components/com_content/tmpl/articles/default.php#L170

Yes I have that

The error occurs in draggable.js. There is a const getOrderData, that has an argument inputRows and this inputRows is empty.

The inputRows are the checkboxes: [name="cid[]"]. Are you using the Grid class to render the check box: https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/blob/5cdef837c9763a711cecdf5a8929622dc4c4b8e4/administrator/components/com_content/tmpl/articles/default.php#L174
