If you want a fixed size slider, please make sure all of your images are the same size. FAQs ? Does the slider support transparent PNG's?

The slider is now responsive and can handle images of any size. ? Can I have multiple sliders on the same page? Yes but you will need to load jQuery v1.7 or greater for it to work. ?

showplus is an eye-catching slideshow to display a set of images with user-defined transition between them. It is easy to get started with but offers a number of customization options for more advanced users. showplus is powered by a slideshow script written entirely in plain JavaScript, and uses no Flash or JavaScript libraries such as MooTools or jQuery. Having a showplus slideshow on a page incurs a footprint of about 14 Kb with only a single CSS file and a JavaScript file included in the page header. Features: + responsive design, scales to arbitrary size + choose from six transition animation types: fade, zoom, pan, Ken Burns effect, push, wipe + attach captions to images with multilingual support using a labels file with fall-back to a default caption + link each image to an arbitrary location + order images according to filename or last modified time, shuffle images each time the page is shown, or specify custom order + quickly navigate between images with a horizontal or vertical navigation bar + set most important styles in the administration back-end + use it with both left-to-right and right-to-left languages + meaningful output even if JavaScript is disabled in the browser

supported Scrolling engines jQueryCarousel (jQuery) ScrollBox (Mootools) supported Popup engines jQueryLightbox Milkbox Pretty Photo This product creates in your article image scrolling gallery with LightBox effects. Now archive consists of two files. ScrollBox PRO install archive. ScrollBoxButton plugin for default Joomla editor. USAGE INSTRUCTIONS The concept is simple. You want to add image galleries inside your articles (content items)! So, create a folder anywhere inside images/stories/, for example call it my_family and upload there all your images. Now create a new content item (or open an existing one) and simply insert, where you want your image scroll gallery to appear. It doesn’t have to be at the end of your article, it can be anywhere you insert it inside your content item. That’s it! Fire up your favorite browser, navigate to your content item et voila! An image scroll gallery inside your content item! If you want to create a gallery from subfolders inside images/stories/, simple add them like this: . In other words, write the path to your target folder without any slashes at the beginning or the end of your path (it’s added automagically!). Don’t forget to adjust the width and height of each thumbnail and set parameters for scrolling gallery part. So, experiment before going public. Also, set the image quality of the created thumbnails. Low quality means better loading times. For performance issues, prefer not to use more than 16-20 images per content item. PlugIn support SWF files. For use it you just have to put SWF in the same folder with pictures. For thumbnails you have to create sub folder named 'flashthumb' and put there JPG files with the same as SWF name.In case there are no thumbnail for SWF plugin will be use own icon with FLASH sign 'automagically'.

A Joomla Slideshow Module ShackSlides is not just a slideshow module, but a way to feature your images in style. The most powerful feature of ShackSlides is the ability to utilize content items as the source for your slideshow. Since it is built using an independent javascript slideshow script, it doesn't matter if you are using jQuery, Mootools, any other Javascript framework or no framework at all. This reduces the number of script conflicts and problems you will have with combining too many different extensions. Easy, Reliable, and Optimized for Joomlashack Templates It works on both Joomla 1.5, 2.5 and 3.0, and support K2, FlexiContent, and Joomla content (so long as these extensions work in the Joomla version). You can easily customize the way it appears by using one of the color themes; and, if you wish, you can override the entire way it displays using Joomla's HTML overrides method. Unlike most free slideshow extensions, you get access to our support for 3 months after purchase. That gives you plenty of time to get the support you need should any problems arise. New features will be added over time, so if you have a great idea for the module let us know! We'd like to build a slideshow module that you need rather than build a module that we think you want. Licensing ShackSlides is released under the GNU GPL v3 license--read full license . Your purchase includes access to support and upgrades for 3 months. ShackSlides Key Features: Over 10 effect options! Support for 4 sources: Joomla Content, K2 Items, FlexiContent Items, or a folder 8 color themes Can be overridden with a template override Slides can be linked to content or an images directory Optional descriptions pulled from content Javascript neutral Easy to translate Changelog Version 2.1 - October 2012 - Joomla 3.0 compatibility - Responsive classes (Bootstrap compatbile) added Version 2.0 - Aug 16, 2012 - Included new source: Visionary - Easy configuration and manage slides and collections through Visionary, without needing the images.xml file.

So you don't have to care if you pictures are all the same resolution, you can even mix horizontal or vertical format images, the eXtro Responsive Fast Slider always creates optimal images. In the backend, just select the folder that stores your pictures for your slider, the picture ratio for slideshow, fade effects, and the slider module does the rest. You can also define whether you want to display the navigation elements for the slider, you can set the slider animation type, animation duration, and many more options. The Slider frontend view is very easy styleable by CSS, 3 different designs are already contained in the CSS file and can be activated anytime. Additionally, the eXtro Responsive Fast Slider will save your ressources, the Slider JavaScript file is only 5kB, so it will be loaded very fast, and your slideshow can be displayed swiftly. New in Slider V1.1.0 - V1.2.8: - the folder for your slider / slideshow can be overridden, any folder can be used for the slider. - the slider now renders transparent PNG images correctly - Improved thumbnail generation - Support for Joomla 3.0 - added greek, polish, italian, bosnian, russian and chinese traditional language translations. NEW in slider V2.0.0 to V2.1.4 - New major version, switched to a better slider script with more and nicer options, adds czech, portuguese and turkish language files and now also uses the Joomla updater. - Now images can be refreshed in the Slider backend with one click. - Improves creation of transparent PNG/GIF images and resolves a minor slider display issue on some templates. - This release improves compatibility with PHP 5.4, J3.x, and makes the slider module overridable. NEW major Version - Fast Slider 3.0.0 This new release of our Fast Slider brings multiple improvements: - Improved CSS styles for nicer look! - Improved directory selection - select from all directories recursively! - Improved Slider Script - now even better! Please note: Effective immediately, we've changed our subscription model. The new subscription model contains a 12 month (1 year) download period for the product, support is optionally bookable. Delivering high quality support (which we believe we do) is the most costly part of our business. We believe that by making support optional, there is a win-win situation with lower prices for customers.

Apart from a normal slideshow module - single slideshow, this is a completely different module: Multislide. Why multi? Because this integrates three famous slideshows in the world: flexslider, zoomslider and nivoslider into one - which certainly not only saves time but makes users feel so excited. Zoomslider: This slideshow surprises users at the first sight. You can see images moving and moving always in the manners of being close to you or being far from you Flexslider: This slider is characterized by thumbnails at the bottom. Besides being displayed or not, these thumbs can be lift up or down by adjusting thumb bottom parameter. Nivoslider: unlike flexslider, nivoslider does not support thumbnails. Instead, it is featured by many effects such as: Fade, Fold, Slice Down Left, Box Rain GrowReserve....

With 3D Gallery, we can make simple elements more interesting by setting them into three dimensional space. Together with CSS transitions, these elements can be moved in 3D space and create a realistic effect. The main idea is to create a circular gallery where we have an image in the center and two on the sides. Since we are using perspective, the two lateral images will appear three dimensional when we rotate them. 3D image slider plugin of Pedro Bothelo from Codrops.

Slicebox is a jQuery 3D image slider plugin that makes use of CSS 3D Transforms and provides a graceful fallback for older browsers that don't support the new properties. With the CSS 3D Transforms we can create some neat effects by transforming elements in three-dimensional space. Slicebox makes use of the 3D transforms properties and allows different kind of effects. The main idea is to create three-dimensional image slices that will rotate and reveal the next image as another side of the 3D object. In case the browser does not support 3D transforms, a simple slider will be used as fallback. Please note that you can only see the cool 3D effect of Slicebox in a browser that supports those CSS3 properties.

This slider was built with user experience in mind, providing a clean and intuitive user interface in the admin area and a smooth navigation experience for the end-users. AP Smart LayerSlider supports keyboard and touch navigation with swipe gesture. It’s a fully responsive and device friendly slider which works perfect in all major devices. AP Smart LayerSlider is layer slider as well, with the ability of adding any HTML contents (texts, DIVs, headings, images, videos, etc.) in layers, where your creativity is unleashed. Highlight features: Fully Responsive. AP Smart LayerSlider is responsive by default. Not only the images will scale down, but the animated layers (where you can add any content) will be scaled down automatically as well. Touch-swipe. The slider's touch-swipe capabilities provides a native-like navigation experience on touch-screen devices. Swipe gestures are enabled for desktop devices as well. CSS3 Transitions. Fast, accelerated CSS3 animations. All animations in the slider are powered by CSS3 transitions, ensuring the smoothest animations that are possible at the moment. Animated Layers. Layers can be both animated and static and they can hold any HTML content. Also, layers can be scaled down automatically or with CSS. Fade Effect. In addition to swipe/slide transitions, AP Smart LayerSlider features a simple and elegant cross-fade transition between slides. Carousel Layout. The slider can show multiple slides in a carousel layout, by allowing you to set different sizes for the individual slide and for the whole slider. Chosen Image Folder. Use images from specific folder in admin, re-order and customize easily (custom title, desription, link). CSS-only controls. All the navigation controls (i.e., arrows, bullets) are CSS-only, webfont scalable vector icons. Smart Video Support. Videos inside the slider will be controlled automatically. For example, when a video starts playing, the autoplay stops, or, when another slide is selected, the video stops. Thumbnails. Thumbnails can contain text, images or both. Also, they can be positioned at top, bottom, left or right of the slides. Lazy Loading. Enables the loading of images only when they are in a visible area, thus saving bandwidth and speeding up the initial page load. Infinite Scrolling (Loop). By default, the slides will be arranged in a loop, allowing infinite scrolling. This can also be disabled, however. Full Width and Full Window. The slider's size can be forced to fill the width or the window even when it's inside a container that would normally restrict it to expand. Auto Height. The height of the slider can be set to adjust automatically to the full height of the currently selected slide. Customizable Orientation. Both the orientation of the slides and the orientation of the thumbnails can be set to horizontal or vertical. Keyboard Navigation. Slides can be navigated by using the keyboard arrow keys.

Hot Zoomer makes a slide show of the selected images using the Ken Burns effect that allows to zoom in and zoom out details of each image. As in any other slide show module, we have duration of each slide set in parameters. However, during that time, image is not displayed statically on the screen. Instead, it zooms in or zooms out all the time. In module parameters, you can graphically select which part of image will be shown on start and which part of image will be shown on end. Therefore, setup of this effect is extremly easy because it's done through user-friendly module backend (see illustration).

Image cube is a responsive image rotator with some really cool 3D effects. The module takes full advantage of the latest CSS 3 technologies for its 12 effects. Sadly that means, that IE 9 and below can't render these effects, but it includes a javascript fallback to a fade transition for IE. Image cube has auto-formatted, responsive thumbnails and uses hardware acceleration on supported browsers. It has simple, semantic markup and supports showing images from a Folder, K2 and Joomla. For Joomla and K2, you can choose to display the Item title and link directly to the item. You can also disable links and titles. For the folder option, you can include custom links. Navigation includes thumbnails or arrows.

Ken Wheeler and the massive Slick community have built a great image carousel for Javascript, which we are now excited to bring to Joomla with our Slick Slider Module (mod_slick). This carousel module is responsive by default, and what's even better is that it has touch capabilities for easier scrolling on mobile devices. We've tried to keep this module as simple as possible, you are not going to be overwhelmed with options like some of the slideshow extensions out there. At this stage we haven't implemented every Slick feature, but if there is a feature that you'd really like to see, please let us know. Features - Fully responsive - Image click behavior - Auto Play - Option to Pause on Hover - Infinite Scroll - Mouse drag - Move slide with touch - Optional navigation dots Images can all be the same size if you like, or they can be different sizes (just make sure they all have the same height). You can select up to 10 images. You can turn off the navigation arrows if you don't want them. Each image can go to a different URL when you click them, and you can insert text below each image if you want, but of course this is optional and not everyone is going to want this.

sigplus Image Gallery Plus is a straightforward way to add image or photo galleries to a Joomla article with a simple syntax. It takes a matter of minutes to set up a gallery but those who are looking for a powerful gallery solution will not be disappointed either: sigplus is suitable for both beginner and advanced users. Even while simple to use, sigplus offers an impressive set of features. Images suitable for gallery preview are automatically generated with cropping and/or centering, and clicking on a preview image brings up a pop-up window overlay (so-called lightbox) showing the original full-size image without navigating away from the current page. Images in a gallery can be displayed in fixed or flow layout, they can be shown on a slider or carousel/rotator, or an image can blend into another using a fancy transition effect. Appearance and behavior are highly configurable including image margin, border, padding, slider/rotator orientation (horizontal or vertical), animation speed, slideshow delay, image sort order, etc. Despite its versatility, sigplus is completely free. It is a full-fledged product with all features included, there is no need to buy a commercial professional version with extra features or purchase club membership that grants you additional privileges. Translations included: English, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew*, Hungarian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovak and Spanish* (asterisk indicates front-end only).

Gallery WD is created with latest web trends coding, thus its sliders look amazingly beautiful with any kind of device, including tablets and mobile devices. What is the difference between gallery and album? Gallery WD uses two types of content - gallery and album. A gallery is a set of images uploaded together based on tag, type and etc. An album is a set of galleries or albums combined based on a certain characteristics. Is there a specific image dimension that works best with Gallery WD? There is no specific images dimension for a gallery, but it will be best if mages will not have larger file dimension of 500-700 KB and maximum 1200x1600 in size. Note that this limitation is encouraged since large gallery will cause a speed decrease of your website and gallery images will be loaded slowly as well. How can I add images to the Gallery WD? The images can be added to Gallery WD using its standard Media Uploader (default uploader the gallery extension). The uploader can be used both for uploading individual or multiple images (by a .zip archived file as well). To make it more convenient you can add separate image directories for each gallery. This way the image uploader will open up faster and you will have gallery images grouped. Can I add images to Gallery WD using FTP? Yes, you can add images to Gallery WD via FTP , however you will also need to do the following. Firstly open /images/comgallerywd/uploads folder of your website and create a new directory in it. It needs to have .original as its title (skip this step, if it already exists). Please upload images to that directory. IMPORTANT: Since the thumbnail is not created this way, you will see broken image icon in Gallery WD file manager. To create thumbnails for those images, please add them to your gallery, select with left checkbox and click Reset. Can I add more than one gallery or album to an article? There is no gallery or album limitation for any article. Using the gallery shortcodes you can add them to the same article. How can I add or remove Social Sharing buttons in Gallery WD ? If you want to add/remove Social Sharing button(s), go to Gallery WD > Options > Lightbox and search for the following options: Enable Facebook button Enable Twitter button Enable Google+ button Enable Pinterest button Enable Tumblr button You can enable/disable whichever option you desire. This action gets applied to the gallery which will be published afterwards. If you need to remove the buttons from already published gallery, edit gallery configuration and specify the same options described above. How can I set thumbnails from landscape to portrait view? You can change the gallery thumbnails from landscape to portrait view by switching the values of Frontend Thumbnail Dimensions option. For this go to Gallery WD in your Components list > select Options > Thumbnail Options . If width is smaller than height, the thumbnail shall appear as portrait. Afterwards please re-insert the shortcode of your gallery and check the thumbnail dimensions in shortcode editor as well. How to create a multi-column gallery? Gallery WD allows defining the number of images to include in each column, as well as number of columns. Please note that both values are absolute values. This means that regardless of the defined column numbers, if your template is not enough in width, the number of gallery image columns will be decreased to the supported area. How to avoid blurry gallery thumbnails for the Gallery WD? When you upload images for your gallery make sure to have a large dimension set within Image Upload settings. This way when you set up gallery thumbnails in shortcode the image thumbnails will not be blurry.

Responsive eXtro jQuery Gallery Responsive eXtro jQuery Gallery - THE responsive gallery for Joomla! Simple to operate, beautiful frontend output. The *Responsive eXtro jQuery Gallery module creates a fully responsive gallery. All you have to do is to select the directory where you stored your images, the responsive gallery module does the rest of the work, like dynamically creating thumbnails for the gallery. Since the gallery output is completely responsive, you'll always get a optimal gallery display on every output device, no matter if smartphone with low resolution or desktop computer with full HD, provided your template is also responsive. In the backend, you can control how the gallery should look in the frontend, for this, there are many self explanatory settings, from defining width and height of the gallery thumbnails to duration of the fade effect. The responsive gallery module is completely styleable by CSS, the output has been separated from design. This allows even better adjustment possibilities to your template, if you want to adapt the gallery theme to the template. New in gallery Version 1.1.0: - The picture folder can now be overridden, ie you can use any folder from your joomla installation for your gallery. NEW in gallery versions 1.2.0 to 1.6.3: - Thumbnail picture generation is now better, no more black bars on top and bottom, plus Joomla 3.0.x compatibility, improves compatibility when using bootstrap framework in your template. - moved to jQuery 1.8.3, adapted the gallery. Additionally, some minor bugs were fixed. V1.4.0 adds video support for some popular video platforms like youtube, vimeo etc. See the gallery documentation for more info. Added localization for french language Better solution for sorting gallery images, it uses natural sorting (like a human would sort). Greek, polish, chinese traditional, slovenian, czech, dutch, bosnian, hungarian, swedish, russian and serbian (latin) language translations has been added. Add your image descriptions more easily in a single file per gallery instead of a single file per image. The gallery now uses the Joomla updater to notify of updates! It also corrects a small issue in IE and corrects improper thumbnail generation that could happen in some cases. Fixes a issue with width/height in some cases and improves transparent GIF/PNG handling and compatibility. Adds portuguese / turkish language files for the gallery, fixes a bug when using more than 2 gallery modules in one article. NEW: eXtro Responsive Gallery V 1.6.4 - This maintenance release of the gallery fixes a bug that could happen under certain circumstances when using the loadmodule plugin in an article to add the gallery modules and then using the article list view.

Now, also all recursive directories can be selected in the Gallery module backend, while retaining full compatibility with older versions! New Version of eXtro Responsive Gallery: V1.7.1 - this maintenance release of the gallery improves compatibility with certain templates and fixes some minor bugs New Version of the eXtro Responsive Gallery: V2.0.0 - this major update brings a brand new gallery script which also involves a design change - now, the gallery has a flat design.

New Version of the eXtro Responsive Gallery: V2.1.0 - this new release of our gallery module resolves a display issue with certain templates when having many images in one gallery Please note: Effective immediately, we've changed our subscription model. The new subscription model contains a 12 month (1 year) download period for the product, support is optionally bookable. Delivering high quality support (which we believe we do) is the most costly part of our business. We believe that by making support optional, there is a win-win situation with lower prices for customers.

SIMGallery is the TRUE community-driven gallery. Integrated seamlessly with JomSocial, EasySocial, Community Builder and JomWall (JS/ES/CB/JW) it allows your users to create and manage their own albums, photos and videos. SIMGallery mirrors the gallery feature of Facebook EXACTLY! Browsing is as easy as using the arrow keys. Key features: - Media type: Photos, Profile Pictures, Videos, Wall photos/videos - Fully responsive: displays beautifully on ALL devices - Theater mode - Watermark - Facebook photos import - Upload/link videos - Remote storage (Amazon S3) - Advanced access settings - Multiple profile pictures management (optional) - Google Maps - Categories (optional). Search albums/photos based on categories - Tag media, post comments, like media, like comments, report media, set photo as profile picture, download photos, set access levels etc etc - 3 different types of tags: tags of users, custom tags, and keyword tags (that can be set in the configuration). If you have keyword tags set, users can search for media based on these tags. - Migrate existing media from JomSocial and EasySocial. Combine categories with keywords for a truly powerful community gallery! Eg. Categories: Houses, Condos and Apartments; Keywords: 2-room, 3-room, refurbished, new. SIMGallery will now display meaningful search results. Allows you to run specific themed websites for real estate, pets, model agency, photography etc or just general community. The sky's the limit! SIMGallery can be used standalone without the need for JS/ES/CB/JW. However, if you're integrating with them, there are 2 levels of integration: Level 1) Post new activities on JS/ES's wall, JomWall, and CB Activity. Also post notifications for JS and ES users. SIMGallery will remain its own separate gallery, while your users will still be able to use JS/ES's gallery. Useful if you need a community gallery with category features. Level 2) SIMGallery will completely take over JS/ES's photo and/or video gallery (ES does not have videos, so SIMGallery fixes that). All links to JS/ES's gallery will be redirected to the relevant SIMGallery links. SIMGallery will automatically create a new Wall Photos album for every user and display wall photos in them! Your users can continue to post wall photos or videos on JS/ES, and they will be linked to SIMGallery. SIMGallery allows admins to set 2 types of user group permissions: 1) Admins - access and delete all media in the frontend regardless of permissions. 2) Media - create albums and upload photos/videos. Instead of all registered users, you can limit this to particular user group(s). SIMGallery comes with 4 modules: the Albums module, Photos module, Videos module and Ranking module. These modules are super highly configurable, and the Ranking module even allows you to run contests on your website. It also comes with JS, ES and CB plugins that will display a user's latest albums, photos or videos on their profiles. It's IMPOSSIBLE to describe everything here!

*** New version 3 released, now compatible with Joomla! 1.5 to 3.x *** Adding image galleries inside your Joomla! articles is now super-easy and simple, using the magical "Simple Image Gallery" plugin for Joomla!. The plugin can turn any folder of images located inside your Joomla! website into a grid-style image gallery with cool lightbox previews. And all that using a simple plugin tag like . So for example, if we have a folder called "mytriptoParis" located in images/stories/mytriptoParis, then we can create our gallery by simply entering the tag into some Joomla! article. The galleries created are presented as a grid of image thumbnails. When your visitors click on a thumbnail, they see the original image in a lightbox popup. The thumbnails are generated and cached using PHP for better results. So let's briefly see what are the main advantages of using Simple Image Gallery: a) You don't need to have an additional gallery component to display a few images, b) you don't need to tell your visitors "to see our photos from Paris click here" and c) you focus more on content writing and less on administering the images! The plugin is ideal for news portals wanting to display some product images, for example, inside their articles. Or for people who quickly wanna show their summer vacation pictures. With Simple Image Gallery, you can have as many galleries as you want inside each article. Please note that if you want to create a gallery from a subfolder located inside your "image gallery root folder", simply adjust the plugin syntax to reflect the remaining path (after your set "root folder"),. Make sure you write the path to your target folder without any slashes at the beginning or the end of your path. You can see a demo of the plugin here: http://demo.joomlaworks.net/simple-image-gallery Simple Image Gallery is a Joomla! plugin developed by JoomlaWorks, released under the GNU General Public License.

eXtro-media Gallery The eXtro-media Gallery is the component version of our very popular gallery module - but it has some advantages over the gallery module due to the fact that some tasks can be more easily performed in a component. Installation is done via the default Joomla installer (Extensions -> Extension Manager -> Install, and upload the gallery component zip file). Afterwards, access the component via Components -> eXtro-media Gallery Manager. The gallery creation process is even easier than in the gallery module version - just click the 'New' button to create a new gallery. Enter a name for your gallery, select the directory where your images are stored, and save - thats it! The gallery component automatically creates thumbnails from your images - this makes the gallery creation process even faster. Though the gallery component is so easy to use, it still has a lot of advanced features - just take a look at the other tabs in the gallery editing view which contain many advanced options . In the frontend, you can display the gallery in several versions: all galleries from all categories all galleries from one category one single gallery as component view one single gallery via the plugin, e.g. within a Joomla article Once displayed, you can click the small thumbnail images for a lightbox view of the full gallery image To make adding a gallery to a Joomla article even easier, we've created a editor plugin - below each editor field, e.g. when editing a Joomla article, you will see a new button labelled 'Insert gallery'. Click this button to get a list of the galleries you created, click one of them to insert the plugin tag into your article. This tag will be replaced in the frontend with the gallery you selected - this is definitely the easiest way to add a gallery to your article! There are many more features - please have also a look at the gallery users manual. NEW Version of the eXtro-media gallery Latest Version: 2.0.0 This new major version of the eXtro-media Gallery brings a brand new gallery script, and resolves some small bugs. The new gallery script is now mobile friendly and touch enabled - you can now use swiping in the gallery! Also, we managed to reduce file size by about 70KB - this means that the eXtro-media gallery will now load even faster with less requests! Finally, the eXtro-media gallery now has a completely new design! New Version of the eXtro-media Gallery Latest Version: 2.1.0 This new minor version of the eXtro-media Gallery corrects a display issue when using many gallery images on certain templates. Additionally, the gallery creation process has been further optimized - full optimized gallery images will now be only created if necessary, i.e. if the option is enabled AND if the optimized full gallery image will not be larger than the original image. If this is true, the original image will be used for the gallery, which saves PHP resources. New Version of the eXtro-media Gallery Latest Version: 2.2.0 This new release of the eXtro-media Gallery component brings various improvements and bugfixes: - A copy function has been added, you can now copy your gallery with two clicks - ACL settings have been improved to reflect changes in the Joomla core ACL - Pagination has been improved - Some smaller bugfixes have been applied New Version of tghe eXtro-media Gallery: V2.2.1 - Improved the BE UX and pagination - Improved the Plugin - Corrected some language strings - plus some minor changes Please note: Effective immediately, we've changed our subscription model. The new subscription model contains a 12 month (1 year) download period for the product, support is optionally bookable. Delivering high quality support (which we believe we do) is the most costly part of our business. We believe that by making support optional, there is a win-win situation with lower prices for customers.

Today we will show you a nice effect for images with jQuery. The idea is to have a set of rotated thumbnails that, once clicked, animate to form the selected image.

SPGM (Simple Picture Gallery Manager) is a very old picture gallery written long before Joomla. It is no longer being developed, so we have taken it over and integrated it into Joomla with our own administrative back-end. SPGM is light-weight, fast, and stable. By today's standards it is "old-fashioned" - it doesn't use lightboxes or animation effects, although it does have a Javascript slide-show. It's fast and can be configured in many different styles. It may be old but it still has a place on some sites. Front-end features include: Fully responsive Supports jpg, png, and gif images Gallery/picture captioning including multi-language captioning Infinite sub-galleries Several sort options for both pictures and galleries Random or fixed thumbnails for gallery lists Optional new pictures highlighting Can optionally show Exif data Slideshow mode Optional automatic drop-shadows around thumbnails and pictures Many options for controlling layout and behaviour The back-end features multi-file uploads, resize on upload, automatic thumbnail generation, creation and renaming of galleries, caption editing, front-end configuration, etc. The PDF user guide explains everything in detail.

One of the best looking and easiest to use image galleries for Joomla! Built around a beautiful and modern responsive design. The demo is a must-see. You'll love it! Justified Fixed-Width Layout... Add beautiful edge-to-edge image galleries to your site with clean, crisp edges, without cropping or changing the aspect ratios of your images. The effect is just like what you see on Flickr, Google Photos and the Windows 10 Photos app - why should the big companies be the only ones with such great photo layouts? Easy to Use... It's easy to add RC Justified Gallery to any article on your site, with just three clicks from the article editor. That, plus automatic thumbnail creation, make this an incredibly easy plugin to use - You can get your first galleries up and running in under 2 minutes. Responsive... RC Justified Gallery looks great on all screen sizes, from phones and tablets up to desktop monitors. It also dynamically resizes as the browser window changes size. Extendable Some high quality add-ons are already available, and more are currently in development. Optional Built-in Shadowbox / Lightbox... RC Justified Gallery includes a gorgeous jQuery based shadowbox (or lightbox), with silky smooth animations done in a way that'll really make your images pop. If you prefer, you can use it with whichever other shadowbox or lightbox plugin you normally use. Customisable... You can change the image spacing and the size of the rows in your galleries, and choose whether or not to show the image names, depending on your needs. Detailed Documentation... While the plugin is very easy to use, its functions are documented in detail in the extensive user guide. New in version 3.2.1: PHP 7 support - There weren't any errors, but have now removed a deprecated API call. New in version 3.2.0: Support for a new addon! There's now a social addon, which lets you add buttons to the shadowbox to share directly to Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or Tumblr. Support for anchor links. Anchor links allow directly linking to an image in the gallery. When the page loads, it scrolls to that image in the gallery, and opens it in the shadowbox seamlessly. New in version 3.1.3: Update to the image sizing algorithm, to keep images much closer to the target row height, for a cleaner, more organized look. New in version 3.1.2: Minor bug fix release New in version 3.1.1: Now supports touch gestures! Mobile users can now swipe left or right to navigate through images in the shadowbox (note that if you're updating from an older version, you may need to change to the newer shadowbox in the plugin's settings to get this feature). Design inspired by Flickr and Google Photos

To use the HiDPI/Retina device support, you need all images in double (2x) size. Default size for thumbnails is 240px x 150px and for fullscreen 960px x 600px. It’s 480px x 300px for thumbnails and 1920px x 1200px for fullscreen images.

In today’s experiment, we created a little gallery that plays with the background and original images. The idea is to have an initial grid-like view of the different categories or albums. In the background we can see the background of the current image of the hovered album.The hovered item will have a color animation. This we create using John Resign Color Animations plugin which you can find here: jQuery Color Animations Plug in. When we click on the album or list item, the colored version of the image fades in, and we are in the “gallery mode” where we can navigate through the images.When we go back now, the current image that we are viewing will fade to its background version and the grid with the album item. Hope you like our new idea!!!!!! ?? General Features : -> Awesome Nice Gallery. -> Hover Different Album with Background Images when you click on it Display album images . -> Next Previous and Back button available with Gallery. -> Set album number of images and background images with Admin Screen. -> Jquery Smooth Effect with Color variation in Different album hover screen. ?

YASIG = Yet Another Slimbox Image Gallery. YASIG is a fork of well known 'Slimbox Image Gallery Plugin for Joomla!' (http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/amystephen/frs/) that was left orphaned by its creator. It's still fast and easy to use, but its functionality is much widened and improved. As it is with every kind of content, also photo gallery is used for information exchange between: Author - maker of a web page and User - person willing to see a content created by the Author (viewer). Specific role of Author is to choose set of pictures which will be presented on Internet to a User. This set of pictures is called gallery. Actions related to preparation of pictures are carried on by Author at so called backstage of web page, so after log on to backstage. Thanks to YASIG preparation of gallery is to some degree automated, what speeds up the process. From User point of view pictures are presented as pictures reduced in size, so called miniatures. After One clicks in any of miniatures, the picture in original size is shown. With aid of keyboard or mouse it's possible to move over the rest of pictures from within gallery set. To sum up, YASIG is photo gallery solution which with aid of few Jooomla! lets you for: processing of photos, that will create Author's gallery, photo presentation to persons willing to see them, to Users viewers of our web page. Processing of pictures (e.g. reducing of size, adding of a frame around pictures etc.) is done at server side, so at first photos have to be send to server. Such way of processing might be convenient to socially oriented web portals. All Author of gallery is required to do is just transfer of chosen files to specified directory at server. Set of YASIG extensions is compatible with Joomla! ver. 3.3.x. It makes use of Javascript JQuery library in quite intelligent way. Correctly processed graphical files consists of .JPG and.PNG pictures. To display pictures in fancy way it's used well known Lightbox effect, but truly it's slimed down 'brother', Slimbox. For purpose of picture processing (shrinking, adding border etc.) GD PHP library is used.

Focus Gallery is a responsive Joomla module to display images in a nice image wall. Creating a truly responsive image gallery can be a very tricky and difficult thing. There are so many factors to consider like the layout and the features, and so many choices to make when it comes to delivering a good viewing experience for every device. Focused on providing suitable image sizes for both, the fluid grid thumbnails and the full image view, the selection of images also depends on container dimensions and not solely on the window size. In some cases it might even be reasonable to load larger thumbnails for a smaller device if we, for example want to show less columns in a grid. So, smaller windows don't necessarily mean smaller thumbnails.

This is my first version of a very simple image gallery; it is built to be used in any bootstrap template, if you are not using Bootsrap the gallery will not display properly. As a first version, I am aware of many limitations, that I hope I will fix/add in the near future. The way it works: Create a folder in the media manager, and uploads the pictures that you want to display in the folder. Once the extension is installed, you need to: Published Add a position Assign on the menu And specify the folder name and the thumb size in the basic parameter fields.

The Merging Image Gallery is an easy-to-install, slick, and light module that displays images by merging all of the images together in the gallery. Click on an image and see the magic. All of the images in the photo gallery merge together creating a bigger image of the image that you select. You can unmerge the images to display the gallery. It is recommended that all images have exact size to display properly - 650 X 425 pixels. Each gallery can contain up to 24 images. Images merge together after you click a specific image. Can place multiple image galleries on the same page. DIRECTIONS Give the module a gallery name ID in each new module that is created. Insert your image URLs, one by one, on each line (do not have more than one image URL on the same line). Change the gallery button/image URLs to your liking (optional). Place the module in the 'debug' or 'analytics' position (depending on your template) of your joomla website, select the pages you want to display the module, and publish the module. To display the image gallery, add a parameter to the URL of any link on your joomla website (Example: reignjoomla.com&itemid=22&com=blahblsh&gallery-name=[gallery-name-id]. Click on your modified link and the image gallery will appear! The 'debug' position is the most common position to use the module for most templates. If you are having problems with displaying the module or if the gallery isn't displaying in the center of the page, contact us and we will be glad to assist.

The Responsive eXtro Lightbox (REL) consists of a module and a plugin. Both versions have their own advantages: The lightbox module automatically creates thumbnail images of the images to display in the lightbox, all you have to do is to define the folder that contains your images. It can be published at any module position, or directly in an article by using the loadmodule plugin. The lightbox creates a so called roadtrip, ie all images are linked togehter and can be switched by clicking the left/right buttons. The plugin version of the Responsive eXtro Lightbox (REL) allows to display thumbnails with lightbox function anywhere on your site. However, the lightbox plugin doesn't automatically create thumbnails, thumbnail and full image must be defined separately in order to display correctly. Like the module, the plugin can also create a roadtrip of the images displayed in which the images are linked together and can be switched by clicking next/previous. The lightbox plugin allows the admin to use optimized tumbnails, or custom thumbnails which display completely different content as the full image, or even just a normal link. The Lightbox Module as well as the plugin are completely built in responsive design. This allows the lightbox to display optimally on small screens (smartphones) as well as up to large desktop displays. The lightbox script is very lightweight, but still offers a lot of functionality (see the documentation). It has been built in new modern flat design. New in V2.1.1 - 2.2.7 - added italian language files - added greek language files - resolved a minor bug - corrects the greek language files - corrects some CSS style in module and plugin for nicer display - corrects a issue in the plugin when using spaces between each parameter - added polish, bosnian,french, russian, romanian and chinese language files **NEW MAJOR VERSION: V3.0.0 ** Now even better! This new major version brings a new lightbox script: we switched to the very popular magnificlb script! Additionally, some minor corrections and adaptions have been made + dutch language files. New Version of the lightbox: V3.0.2 - V3.1.2 - This version adds a new feature to rebuild the thumbnails, e.g. when manual changes have been made. - This maintenance release add turkish language files. - this maintenance release of the lightbox improves compatibility with some templates when adding the lightbox scripts. New Version of the Lightbox module & plugin V3.2.0 of the lightbox brings these improvements: - better directory selection in the lightbox module: you can now select from all directories recursively - the lightbox has now improved responsiveness New Version of the eXtro Lightbox: V4.0.0 This new major version of the lightbox brings these improvements: - a brand new editor plugin makes creating the lightbox plugin tag even easier - the lightbox plugin will now create a thumbnail image automatically - but you still can use your own lightbox thumbnail image - so you are not forced to use the tn creation process - 2 new options for the thumbnail image Latest Version of the eXtro Lightbox gallery: V4.0.1 - corrected a small issue in the lightbox plugin - removed loading of the JS script when lightbox not needed on page Please note: Effective immediately, we've changed our subscription model. The new subscription model contains a 12 month (1 year) download period for the product, support is optionally bookable. Delivering high quality support (which we believe we do) is the most costly part of our business.

BK-Thumb is a multi-purpose image plugin for Joomla that can automatically create thumbnails and popups of the original images, as well as resize the full-size images or add a watermark to them. It can even scramble the images names so that people cannot guess their original non-watermark locations. For articles shown in blog mode, it can create a link from the first image to the full article for better user navigation. It can also create a simple photo gallery from any folder by just including one of the images from the folder and give it the description (alt text) "mt_gallery" (or using the new tagging feature). See the examples and how-to's below for inspiration and instructions! Please note that when you use BK-Thumb for the first time on a given page, the server has to process all the images which might take quite some time. The same applies when you clear BK-Thumb's cache. For upgrade install a new version without uninstalling the previous one. Release 2.5.0: iLoad gallery prettyPhoto slideshow Image grouping for slideshow Resizing images to user defined size More watermarking control Gallery image caption control Leading images size Release 2.4.3: Shadowbox support was added. thickbox no more supported. prettyPhoto support was added.

The EasyImageCaption plugin for Joomla generates captions from article images’ title or alt attributes and displays them below (or above) the images. An optional data-copyright attribute can be used to display copyright or license information for the image next to the caption. How It Works EasyImageCaption works out-of-the-box. After installation through Joomla’s extension manager, you just have to enable it, and all your article images will automatically show captions on front-end pages. You may however restrict “captionizing” to certain images or certain articles through the plugin parameters. The generated source code is 100% valid HTML5 for maximum browser compatibility and smooth integration into your website. Captions will also work on responsive websites (depending on your template, you may have to add some additional CSS). The captions can be styled individually through your template’s CSS file(s) or through the built-in basic style settings.

Zoom Lightbox will make your site capable to zoom any type of contents: images, text, form fields and many more. This plugin will show in frontend as a little toolbar that you can position at the top or at the bottom of the page ready to zoom contents. All you have to do is activating zoom plugin with switcher provided inside the bar, and click with the special mouse cursor representing a zoom lens on the content you want to magnify. The contents will be cloned in a lightbox window with the zoom factor applied and a lens effect will enlarge contents when hovering the mouse pointer. You can choose to: - Use the lens effect to enlarge contents when hovering the mouse pointer - Use the lightbox window to show enlarge contents when clicking on elements It's ideal for example as an accessibility WCAG tool or to relax your eyes reading contents with very small font size, to see image's details, or to fill form with more visible inputbox. Zoom Lightbox has a selector engine that chooses the element you clicked on to magnify it only if it's a valid element, in other words only if the element is not too small on the page. You can set the minimum dimensions of a page element to be zoomed, but if the element clicked is too small not to be considered, Zoom Lightbox chooses its parent element and so on until it reaches a valid dimensions element to zoom it alomg with its contents.

Responsive Virtual Preview This module creates virtual preview images. The module has been developed mainly to virtually hang paintings on a wall - but of course it can be used for other similar cases. This is being achieved by adding the paintings' image to the image containing the room. The result is a virtual preview of the room with the painting on the wall, so the viewer can see how the actual room would look like. Advantages are: The viewer doesn't have to physically own the painting to (pre)view it on the wall. Many paintings can be checked out in short time, without hanging them on the wall, e.g. before buying a painting. All that is needed is a main image (e.g. a image of a room) and some other images (e.g. different images of paintings) so they can be added to the main image. The result is a image which contains the other images so you can e.g. get a preview how the room would look like with the painting on the wall. You can select which image should be added to the main image by clicking on it in the navigation bar. This navigation bar contains all images that should be added to the main image, and you can see the result by clicking on them. Since the module uses responsive techniques, its content will always be displayed in a optimal way, no matter if you view it on a smartphone with small screen resolution or on a desktop with huge screen resolution. NEW in Versions V1.2.2 - V1.4.5 - added greek language translations - added french language translations - added dutch language files - corrected greek language files - produces now even better looking images - fixes a small bug - added polish, swedish and chinese traditional lanaguage files - improved the image creation process, now uses less ressources - russian language files added, now also uses the Joomla updater - images now refreshable NEW Version 1.5.0 - 1.5.1 This release makes the module overridable and improves compatibility with PHP 5.4+ and J3, and adds turkish language files Responsive Virtual Preview - NEW Version V1.6.0 This release of the Responsive Virtual Preview module adds a better way to select your image directory - you can now select from all directories recursively, not only the first directory level.

This component allows you to dynamically resize and compress your site images. It includes a plugin framework, and is available with plugins to add a watermark, and to apply dynamic resizing to all your article images, and to restrict image viewing to chosen user groups. The component can cache the resized images, and also allows you to encode the image path, which is useful if you want to hide the location of your original image files. Optionally the image resizer can also include "lazy loading", so that images are only loaded when they are scrolled into view, further speeding up page loading. The method of accessing the image resizer is very simple, you just pass the image to the component in an URL. This means that the image generator could potentially be integrated quite easily into any Joomla extension. News Version 2.1.1 improves support for browser caching and Cloudflare caching Version 2.1.0 fixes some issues which stopped it from working in PHP 5.5 and above, and adds support for the Joomla updater Version 2.0.3 fixes a problem with the language file that prevented the component from being visible in the Joomla component dropdown list Version 2.0.2 includes some bug fixes Version 2.0.1 fixes some bugs mainly with the watermark and image restrict plugin. The image resizer plugin optionally includes lazy loading Version 2.0.0 This release is for the first time compatible with Joomla 3.0 as well as Joomla 2.5 Version 1.1.1 The new release improves the handling of transparent PNG images. There are new versions of both the main component and the watermark plugin. If you update to these you should find that PNG images are now handled correctly. There are also some small improvements to the image resizer plugin - it should now correctly pick up image style and alignment information. Version 1.1.0 includes some improvements to usability, and also includes a new plugin that allows you to restrict image viewing on your site to chosen user groups, for example registered users only.

siteLogo is a Joomla! Model-View-Controller(MVC) module to simplify multiple tasks when placing a logo on a website. The tasks mentioned above are the creation of a division(div) with a background with or without the following options: a link to a predesignated Uniform Resource Locator(URL) or the base URL of the website, or domainname. GUI-event, hover- or mouseovereffect created with Sprites technology. Separate Cascading Style Sheet(css) option. Update: Some servers set the allowurlfopen and allowurlinclude PHP directives to off for security reasons (PHP include hack) which resulted in an error: Warning: getimagesize() ...... With the help of Mihai-Codrut Onofrei we resolved this issue by replacing the getimagesize by a cURL construction. Update 22-03-2016: reprogrammed parts of siteLogo.

Upload, resize and edit images for Joomla! and K2. Integrates with Joomla! Custom Fields providing responsive images, retina images, automatic image resizing, multiple image sizes, custom image names, image editor and many other great features in a single extension! Responsive images in Joomla! done right Econa integrates responsive images in Joomla! using the HTML5 srcset attribute. Econa allows you to define different image sizes for targeting different devices. Your site will serve automatically the most appropriate image size depending on the visitor's device saving user's bandwidth and thus making your site load faster. Here is a brief overview of how it works: You define image sizes according to your needs. You can select the resize width and quality for each one of them. You ( optionally ) add rules to define which image size will be served using CSS media queries. It's that simple to add responsive images to your site. Did we mention that Econa can also handle retina images? If you define additional images sizes with higher resolution the retina devices will get served those images automatically. The responsive images functionality applies to images uploaded through the Econa Image Custom Fields, Econa image tab and content images ( images inserted in the articles or K2 items text ) . Joomla! 3.7 Custom Fields Integration - Add multiple resizable images to Joomla! articles with Econa Image Custom Field Econa now integrates with Joomla! 3.7 Custom Fields allowing you to upload, resize and edit images to your Joomla! articles! Using custom fields you can add as many images as you want! Each Econa Image Custom Field allows you to upload an image from your computer or select an image from your server. The extension will create different sizes of that image automatically. You can define up to ten image sizes and select the width and the resize quality for each one of them when you create the custom field. You can also add a caption, credits and alt text for the uploaded image and even define the image filename for improving your site's SEO. The result filename will be the text you entered plus an identifier for the image size. If for example you enter the text "apples" to be used as the filename the result for the large image will be "applesL.jpg" or "applesL.png" if the image is in PNG format. Econa can handle JPEG, GIF and PNG images, but transparency is not maintained when the image is resized by Econa. Image uploading and processing is performed using AJAX to make the user experience faster. **Note that Econa Image Custom Fields require Joomla! 3.7 or later. Econa Image Tab Econa adds an extra tab named "Image" in the Joomla! articles edit form. It allows you to upload an image from your computer or select an image from your server to use as the article image. The extension will create different sizes of that image automatically. You can define up to ten image sizes and select the width and the resize quality for each one of them. Econa also allows you to define different image sizes per Joomla! category! You can also add a caption, credits and alt text for the uploaded image. Econa even allows you to define the desired filename for the uploaded image. The result filename will be the text you entered plus an identifier for the image size. If for example you enter the text "apples" to be used as the filename the result for the large image will be "applesL.jpg" or "applesL.png" if the image is in PNG format. Econa can handle JPEG, GIF and PNG images, but transparency is not maintained when the image is resized by Econa. Image uploading and processing is performed using AJAX to make the user experience faster. Econa Image Editor Both Joomla! articles and K2 items now get a great image editor! Econa allows you to perform basic image editing operations like cropping, rotating and flipping directly in the Joomla! article and K2 item edit forms. So, if you enable the Econa "Image Tab" for articles or you create Econa custom fields you will also get an edit button for launching the image editor. In case, you are using K2, the editor is integrated directly in K2's "Image" tab. Custom Image Names for K2 Items Improve K2 SEO by giving custom names to your K2 items images! You can enter the desired filename for the item image in the corresponding field that Econa adds in K2 "Image" tab in the item edit form. The result filename will be the text you entered plus an identification for the image size. If for example you enter the text "apples" to be used as the filename the result for the large image will be "apples_L.jpg" . Note that K2 converts all uploaded images in JPEG format and this cannot be changed by Econa. In addition to custom image names, Econa makes the K2's image uploading experience even better! All image uploads are now performed using AJAX requests making things even faster. Resize Content Images Econa can also optimize the images that users add to Joomla! articles or K2 items content! There are two methods available for handling content images: Simple method: Any image added using the WYSIWYG editor will be resized to the dimensions set by the user using the editor. Let's say for example that one user of the site uploads a really high resolution image to insert in the article text. Then he resizes that image using the article's WYSIWYG editor to 600x600 pixels. Normally, Joomla! will load the large image in front-end and then the browser will resize it to 600x600 pixels. This adds a lot of extra unnecessary load to the page. When using this method, the image will get resized automatically to 600x600 pixels saving your site's bandwidth! Responsive images method: This method allows you to define up to ten sizes to get generated for images added in the content of Joomla! articles and K2 items. Econa will generate automatically the HTML5 srcset attribute based on the generated images in order to make the images inserted in the WYSIWYG editor responsive! Resize Article Images If for some reason you don't want to enable the "Econa Image Tab" for your articles, you can set Econa to resize the article's default "Intro" and "Full" images that can be found under the "Images and Links" tab in articles form.

Use it anywhere you want, as many times as you want. In articles, category descriptions, modules - anywhere Joomla processes content plugins. Note: The CatchMyFame.com Before/After jQuery plugin is released under the CC Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license. If using this plugin on a commercial site, a license must be purchased from CatchMyFame.com. Several other paid extensions in this category use the same CC licensed javascript - and even though you pay for the Joomla extension, you still have to license it for commercial use with CatchMyFame.com. The plugin provides default settings, plus the article author can override each of the default settings in the image wrapper using data attributes. Full instructions are in the plugin configuration page. Additionally, I've implemented the Touch-Punch plugin, so this works on touch devices such as iPad, iPhone and Android tablets and phones. I wrote this on commission, and my client waived his option for copyright because he believed as I do - that this plugin will benefit the Joomla community. Anyone who is familiar with me or my extensions knows that I love free. Update 1.2 - fix coding error which affected starting position Update 1.3 - fix javascript error where Joomla.JText is missing the "_" function on some sites.

Fast and flexible plugin of an automatic thumbnail creation for images of your Joomla content. Many Joomla! users have faced the need to output articles in a category or section blog layout, especially multi-column, with smaller pictures while retaining their original size inside the article view. It may sometimes also be necessary to include a picture of reduced size accompanied with a link to the full size image in the article view. SmartResizer plug-in is a universal solution to those needs. This light plug-in creates two thumbnails for an image inside an article: the first is for inclusion inside the article and the second is for a category or section blog. This makes it possible to create a small thumbnail for a category blog, section blog and front page articles, and a midsize thumbnail for the article view. The plug-in also automatically creates a link to a full-size image if the picture has the thumbnail inside the article. The plug-in can create a third large thumbnail to open as the fullsize image. Nice feature, if a site upload photos directly from the camera with a very large size. There are some features of the plugin: - crop or fit image to thumbnail size. - Auto ajust size of thumbnail, if you set only width or only height of thumbnail. - Three ways to store thumbnails: in the same folder as original image; in cache folder; in subfolder 'smart_thumbs' of original folder. - Processing of remote images. - Three ways to open original image: popup window, Joomla SqweezBox, Highslide effect. - Allows to show the caption under or above the thumbnail.

Easy Image Resizer for Joomla! automatically resizes the resolution of images which are uploaded through the Media Manager. This is often useful if images are not previously processed offline and uploaded in a too large resolution. The automatic resizing also reduces the size of the images, which can lead to serious performance improvements of the loading time. The plugin is executed directly when uploading images in the media manager and the 'Image' button in the edit mode. Easy Image Resizer implements the service by Optimus.io for a lossless compression of images. Use this feature to get even better results! With the option "Safe Image Names" the image names are converted to make them safe for the upload process. UTF8 characters are encoded to ASCII, special characters are removed, whitespaces are replaced with underscores and the resulting string is converted to lowercase.

Drag Gallery is a slideshow that is draggable and has two views: fullscreen and small carousel. In fullscreen view, a related content area can be viewed. The main idea is to translate the slider on the Z axis, allowing it to be either fullscreen or of a smaller carousel size. By switching the actual size of the slideshow and removing the transforms when they are not needed anymore, we allow the slideshow to have a "real" size (i.e. 25% of the window). For the content part, we slide everything up and reveal a scrollable area.

Croping plugin that will help you to upload images trough Joomla! media manager! How it works and what it does? Install the plugin through the Joomla! installer. Go to Extensions -> Plugins. Find Content – Crop and open it for edit. Define the sizes that you are planning to use on your web site. You may add unlimited sizes, but be aware that if these are more than 10, depending on your server, the upload process may go slower than usual. Enter only values in pixels. Do not enter px or any other characters. After defining the sizes that you are going to use, save the plugin and exit the edit screen. Now when uploading images through the Joomla! Media Manager, these are also resized and cropped (in the center) in the dimensions entered by you in the plugin parameters. The cropped images are stored in folders with their size as a name. For example images with size 640x360 are stored in /images/640x360/filename.jpg Be aware: This plugin will NOT crop your already uploaded images. It works only for new uploads. You cannot select what part of the image to crop. It is always cropped in the middle. The plugin creates images in the selected (by you) proportions, but the authors are the one to place the right image with the right size on the right place. If you change the predefined sizes, your existing images will not crop in the new sizes.

More particularly, this plugin is adding animations, change positions, angles and box shadow under images. The plugin is reaching the same performance as Javascript/Jquery, but doesn't need so much resources. How does this image plugin change your images? - Initial animation done by css3 - hover animation - Polaroid effects and static shadow - Make a zoom when a mouse is hovered increases size of the images up to 140% of the original size. - 3D box shadow, that is animating during few second of movements - 3D transformation and rotation

Pop Image Slider provides an impressive and interactive way to view images. The images slide left and right according to the cursor movement and when cursor is over an image, the image is magnified. The images are also links to urls specified by you. These links may open using the lightbox effect or in parent or blank window. Also the links may refer to web pages or file types such as image, video, sound, flash. Now there is no need to edit images in order to style them. Styles like border, shadow, rounded corners, gap between images can be achieved though the module parameters. The height and the width of the images, in normal and zoomed state, are automatically calculated based only on two parameters: a) the height in normal state and b) the percentage of the magnification. The users of the extension asked for more features (like Phoca Gallery support, image swap on mouse over, endless sliding etc.) and now these features are supported. Note: In case you use Joomla 2.5 and jQuery is not already loaded, enable the relative parameter in the module. Change Log: http://joomla.impression-estudio.gr/pop-image-slider/guide.php

Please note that if you want to use a newer version of the panorama plugin or outside a Joomla! please purchase a license from: http://codecanyon.net/item/360-panoramic-viewer/2684810 This module is built up on the 360 panorama jquery plugin from Minimalistic Studio. The reason why we choose this 360 plugin is that it is the best we've found on the web (lean code and nice to handle). We've turned it into a Joomla! 2.5 module where you can specify a lot of settings in the backend with ease. This module has the following features: autoscrolling of the view scrolling with the mousewheel 2 types of hotspots (area or dots) where you can specify teaser, background color, description and a link. Hotspots can easily created with the online map editor: http://www.maschek.hu/imagemap/imgmap caption of the slider with 4 selectable positions (left, right, top or bottom) show or hide scrollbuttons mulitple instances of the modules are possible on the same site

Using VRC Gallery you can now show 360 Degree Images & Videos on your Joomla Website. Some of the Sailent Features are: Horizontal view: Allow only horizontal camera control.[Example: true] Camera FOV: Camera field of view in degree.[Example: 60] Reverse Dragging: Reverse orbit control direction.[Example: true] Passive Rendering: Render only when control triggered by user input.[Example: true] Autorotate: This parameter is used to enables automatic rotation of image and video[Example: true]. Autoswitcher: This parameter is used to enables automatic switching of images/ videos after specific time interval, if the module is not being used by user for specific time interval, then auto-switch the images/videos.[Example: true] Time: Enter time to auto-switch image and video. [Example: 30] Wondering How it works? Here are the steps on how to upload 360 Content. Install the module in Joomla backend and then follow the below steps: - Create sub folder under "images" folder at the Joomla root folder. (Check the Notes below) - Upload 360 images/videos into that folder using FTP. - Select that specific folder from the "Select Folder" dropdown of the module in the backend. - Configure other parameter as per your requirement. - Set module position, select page on which you want to display module for front end view. - Click on save button. - Module will display images/videos of selected folder to selected position at frontend. Note: If you have sub-folder which has only 360 Images/Videos under "images" folder at the Joomla root folder, then you can select that folder from the "Select Folder" option of the module at backend, otherwise you can upload 360 images and videos in default folder of the module, which is "modules/modvrc360/assets/images_videos".
