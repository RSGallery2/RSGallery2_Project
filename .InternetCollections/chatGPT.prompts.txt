article to the start date jform_com_fields_startdatum if it exists" - it 
worked immediately in the backend but not in the frontend. Then chat GPT 
sent me some debug possibilities and I figured out it was because the 
context in frontend is different and "we" changed to code to work on 
frontend too. From this point I would add language files and a setting 
in the xml myself. Sometimes in future in case more people would need it.
