security.txt is a proposed standard for websites' 
security information that is meant to allow security 
researchers to easily report security vulnerabilities.[1][2] 
The standard prescribes a text file called "security.txt" 
in the well known location, similar in syntax to robots.txt 
but intended to be machine- and human-readable, for those 
wishing to contact a website's owner about security 
issues.[3] security.txt files have been adopted by 
Google, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook.[4]


security.txt files can be served under 
the /.well-known/ directory (i.e. /.well-known/security.txt) 
or the top-level directory (i.e. /security.txt) of a website. 
The file must be served over HTTPS and in plaintext format.[10]
