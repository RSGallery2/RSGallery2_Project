sudo apt-get install php-xdebug

You should check your PHP modules list and see xdebug in there now. You will also need to restart Apache2 if you are using it.

php -m

sudo service apache2 restart

But, there was a problem, I wasn't getting any stack traces. Adding a call to phpinfo() in my site showed that indeed, stack traces were turned off. So I edited the config file to manually enable traces on errors (just add the snippet to the bottom of the file).

vi /etc/php/7.0/mods-available/xdebug.ini
xdebug.show_error_trace = 1

After restarting Apache2 once again, everything was back to normal. In my case I also needed SOAP and CURL for a specific site, so I picked those up too with:

sudo apt-get install php-soap php-curl
