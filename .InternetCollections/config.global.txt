
 how to get value from configuration file


The documentation on how to do it is slightly outdated:

http://docs.joomla.org/JFactory/getConfig

But if you check the code they actually drop the ampersand function:

https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/blob/staging/components/com_users/models/registration.php

$config = JFactory::getConfig();
$fromname = $config->get('fromname');
