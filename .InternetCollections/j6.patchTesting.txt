Thank you all for your help with PBF,
Joomla 6 is approaching and there are a 
growing number of prs to test.
I wrote this article some years back

https://magazine.joomla.org/all-issues/november-2021/work4joomla-apply-within

and I am proposing to spend every Friday 
afternoon from 3pm UTC to 5pm UTC to 
devote to weekly patch testing.
I will be in a chat room to go though the 
J6 patches and with your help we can test 
and comment back to the authors if there 
is an issue, or test and if its passed and 
in line with J6 I will merge it there and 
then !!!!! OMG actual merging.

So please, do make a little time if you can 
this Friday and many Fridays to come and look 
out for the room and links

To get something into Joomla, we need someone 
to write the patch, two people to test the patch 
and one of two to merge the patch.
It is the testers we need.
To anyone wanting to add a PR to Joomla 6, not 
everything will make it, we need to refine, 
refactor and make sure it's something the 
majority will use. 

Please, Please, Please make sure you have added 
any documentation to manual.joomla.org and write 
good instructions, with good instructions you w
ill get good tests. Poor instructions will leave 
the pr untested.
