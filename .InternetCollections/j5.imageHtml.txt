What do we prefer

A) -- <?php echo LayoutHelper::render('joomla.html.image',
or
B) ++ <?php echo HTMLHelper::_('image', 

using the Helper I can add whatever I want... can't do that with JLayout
@benbelimen... just did... sizes, srcset, class 
and more specific for my case... custom data-atttributes
how to add any attribute to layout?
aha... all what is inside displayData... 


2) if you want to have your images overridable, you use the HTMLHelper otherwise you can use the layout

3) This <?= LayoutHelper::render('joomla.html.image',
The HTMLHelper is doing a lot more work and unless you're doing some image stored in the media folder it should be avoided!\
