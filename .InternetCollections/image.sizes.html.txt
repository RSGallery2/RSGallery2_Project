The dimensions of the original image you upload to your site can have a big impact on how it displays. 
We recommend using images that are between 1500 and 2500 pixels wide. Images smaller than 1500 pixels 
may appear blurry or pixelated when they stretch to fill container s, such as banners.09.07.2019

The best image resolution for most smartphones is 640 by 320 pixels, although you should ideally 
maintain the aspect ratio of the original image or the output image will be distorted

Inside Content Images
Horizontal – max width 1500px, jpeg, saved for web, and optimized
Vertical – max width 1000px, jpeg, saved for web, and optimized

Important considerations:

 if you are preparing images for your slideshow galleries: make sure they are all 
 the same height recommended 1500px, regardless if they are horizontal or vertical
 
 if you are preparing images to upload inside a blogpost, make sure they are all 
 the same width, recommended 1500px, regardless if they are horizontal or vertical
 

a. Using the Image Size Info Extension
The first method to find image sizes for your site is by using the Image Size Info 
extension for Chrome (If you don’t use Chrome on your computer, we highly recommend 
using it while creating your site). Once you’ve installed the extension, this tool 
will then allow you to find out the image sizes of every image element on your site.
