Responsive images for articles
What is it?
A tiny content plugin that create a few different sized images on the fly and also update the markup to use the well established and supported HTML5 image tag srcset

What type of images are supported?
Only jpg and png

Which image sizes will be generated?
320px, 480px, 768px, 992px, 1200px, 1600px, 1920px These sizes refer to the width of each image.

Does it also take care of the intro and full image of an article?
No.

Are there any precautions?
YES! Because the plugin creates the images on the fly if a user saves a new article then the first time a visitor visits that page the load time can be very long. An easy work around is that the creator saves the article with some elevated permissions and then visits the page (granted they have permissions) and then re-edit the article to restore the preferred permissions. Also if you already have a live site, it's highly recommended to create the extra images locally (eg use some browser plugin to visit all your pages in your sitemap). The extra images are placed in /media/cached-resp-images

Installation
Just upload the zip! Then enable the plugin and you're set. Maybe you change some options, but it works immediately and fine by default.

Options
Image quality: you can choose the quality of the generated images. This quality setting affects the file size of the image! [Default: 85]
Type of scaling: Joomla! have some types of scaling. So here you can choose one of them. [Default: SACEL_INSIDE]
Allow scaling up: Smaller images as the sizes above will be skipped each by default. Example: Your image width is 1000px, so this plugin generates images with 320px, 480px, 768px and 992px width. If you allow scaling up, it will generate 1200px, 1600px and 1920px also.
Cleanup on uninstall: If you really uninstall this plugin, the folder with the generated images will be deleted. [Default: FALSE]
Is there a way to clean the cached images?
Sure: just ftp, ssh or use your host control panel and remove the folder named cached-res-images inside the folder media. CAUTION: Performing this action will force the plugin to regenerate all the required image sizes for each image which will effectively increase geometrically the loading time for each page delivered for the first time!!!

Documentation
Read the above.
If you change anything in the options, this have effect to new generated images only! If your new options should affected to all images, you must clear the cached images. How to this read above.
Support
The only valid support will be fixing possible bugs...

Are there any plans for more features?
Not for this free version.
