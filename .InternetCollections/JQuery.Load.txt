jQuery JavaScript Framework
In order to load jQuery, use JHtml::_('jquery.framework');
This will load the jQuery version 1.11.1 library in no conflict mode. 
This means it is accessed via the jQuery namespace, not through $.
To load it in normal mode, call JHtml::_('jquery.framework', false);

jQuery UI Framework
The JUX libraries include the core jQuery UI code plus Widget, Mouse, 
Position, and Sortable (version 1.8.23 as of Joomla 3.0.2). Please 
review the jQuery-UI documentation for further details on their usage.
In order to load the core call: JHtml::_('jquery.ui');
This will load the appropriate jquery-ui.core.js from the media/jui 
directory. Enabling jQuery UI automatically enables jQuery in 
noConflict mode if it has not already been done.
To add the Sortable library, use JHtml::_('jquery.ui', 
array('sortable')); This will automatically include the core 
jQuery UI library and the jQuery library.
For clarity, it is best to explicitly enable both the core and 
sortable from a single call using JHtml::_('jquery.ui', 
array('core', 'sortable'));
As of Joomla 3.0.2, only jQuery UI Core and Sortable are 
installed/available. To use other jQuery plugins, including 
jQuery UI plugins, you will need to make sure they are installed 
with your application and call JHtml::_('script') along with the 
appropriate parameters to load them. Alternatively, you may 
create and install your own JHtml extensions and create your own 
JHtml calls - such as JHtml::_('mylibrary.myloader')

----------------------------------
Loading jQuery & Bootstrap
Just for completeness the equivalent code for loading the JQuery library isÂ 

JHtml::_('jquery.framework');

For jQuery UI

JHtml::_('jquery.ui');

and for BootStrap

JHtml::_('bootstrap.framework');
