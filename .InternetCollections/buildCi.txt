experience using a raspberry pi as git/ci/build server with docker

use my raspberry pi 4 in combination with forgejo and forgejo respectively github actions and an docker action-runner for build and ci. 
he forgejo server runs on a vps and only the actions runner runs here locally on my raspberry
