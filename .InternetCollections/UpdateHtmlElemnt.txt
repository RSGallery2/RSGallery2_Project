
I have solved my question, took me hours to see what i 
was doing wrong, sometimes stepping away from a problem 
helps you think about it differently. OK so we know that 
Joomla uses different plugins and libraries to get its 
backend to work. One of these Joomla plugins is something 
called chosen http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/.

this plugin changes or manipulates a select element. 
this is why it was rendering differently in browser. 
so what i was missing really from my code is a way 
to refresh my change on the ui and below is how you do it.

dType.val(data.message.discount_type).trigger('liszt:updated');
