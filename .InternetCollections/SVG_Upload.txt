Beim JCE kann man auch SVG Dateien einbinden, man muss sie nur vorher bei Profile bei 
 dem Datei Browser und dem Bilder Manager erlauben.

Ich habe keine Erfahrungen mit JCE, aber z.B. Quantum Manager hat dafür ein 
System plugin, so wenn man es einschaltet, kann man überall im System Quantum 
Manager sehen, wenn man auf Media Button klickt. 
BTW Quantum Manager zeigt auch SVGs (ohne Hack)

[Tutorial] About using SVG images in ZOO and Joomla

Did you try to upload an SVG (scalable vector graphics) image you want to use in a 
ZOO Textarea element or a ZOO Image element? You will find that it is not possible 
to upload the image nor can it be selected, and it is not shown in the image 
selection list even though you are sure it exists.
The culprit is Joomla's built-in Media Manager and its security features. You can 
not upload or select an *.svg image via the Joomla Media Manager. This affects ZOO, 
but also Joomla articles, modules, and every other component where the Joomla Media 
Manager is involved.
Bear in mind that SVG is a highly dangerous file format and one of many ways to 
introduce malicious code into a website.
Usually you will get the notice "This file type is not supported." when you try 
to upload an *.svg image?

Going to _Adding svg to the list of legal extensions and image/svg+xml to the list 
of legal MIME type does not solve the problem:
The message you will get is "Possible IE XSS Attack found." or "Not a valid image."

Which message you are stopped by depends on the "Restrict Uploads" and 
"Check MIME Type" and their Yes/No settings.
No matter what you set you will not be able to place SVG images this way. Bear in mind 
that SVG is a highly dangerous file format and one of many ways to introduce malicious 
code into a website. So consider it "well meant", which is usually the opposite 
of "well". ;-)
But ZOO as well as Joomla aricles or modules do support *.svg images.
Just upload an image to images/my-image.svg via FTP, in your ZOO Textarea element then 
switch the editor to HTML / source view and manually enter the following HTML markup:
<img src="images/my-image.svg" height="100" width="100" alt="An SVG image">
This image — provided it exists in the given location — will be shown and displayed 
by ZOO.
Unfortunately the "Select Image" button of a ZOO Image element has to conform to the 
Joomla interface and use the Joomla Media Manager. The only way to get an SVG here is 
to manually enter the relative URL to an SVG image existing on your server:
Image
This SVG image will also be used and displayed by ZOO.
Advanced Information, courtesy of Phillip:
If you are capable of editing the SVG file's source you should make sure it has the 
following structure:
<svg>  
    [the various elements of the image ...]  
</svg>

As in for example
<svg  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">  
    <rect x="10" y="10" height="100" width="100" style="stroke:#ff0000; fill: #0000ff  "/>  
</svg>
What Joomla does in fact look for to recognize (and block) an SVG are certain HTML and 
XML tags. If those are not part of the file, Joomla usually wouldn't consider it to be 
an SVG file in the first place, and has no objections anymore.
Thank you
