<h2 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the forum of RSGallery2</h2>
<p>RSGallery2 is a Joomla! gallery component from the old days (since the Mambo days 2004) when Joomla! started.

The forum response comes within appropiate time and the sources are in github.<br /> <strong>The use of RSGallery2 is free as in free beer</strong>.
