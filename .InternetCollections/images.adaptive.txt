Best practice? Best practice is to not try to determine screen size, because ultimately it is futile. What will happen when a large screen user changes their browser window size, for example?

Then use CSS3 media queries to hide 3 of them:

@media (max-width: 767px) {
    .item_2, 
    .item_3,
    .item_4 {
        display: none;
    }
}

jquery and different includes on resize

#Is jQuery really necessary just for this?

No, but I'm sure you know that's just how I roll in general and it makes it easier. Kevin Hale wrote about dynamic resolution layouts literally five years ago. It's "raw" JavaScript and still works great today.

Also, there is a kick ass polyfill: Respond.js
