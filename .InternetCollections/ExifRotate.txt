If you ever need to write a Joomla extension that handles image uploads, you might want to rotate the image to the correct rotation if the image has been taken on a phone.
Sometimes the image will be rotated at incorrect angles because the browser don't support or ignores the orintation information from the image's EXIF data.
You can solve this problem by using this simple script in your Joomla extension.


// Path to an image containing exif data
$imagePath = "/images/taken-with-an-iphone.jpg";

// new JImage object from image path
$image = new JImage($imagePath);  // .../image

// Read the exif data from the image
$exif = exif_read_data($imagePath);
$rotate = 0;

// Get the angle to rotate the image based on the orientation
if (!empty($exif['Orientation'])) {

    // Based on the orientation of time image, assign the rotation angle.
    switch ($exif['Orientation']) {
        case 8:
            $rotate = 270;
        break;
        case 3:
            $rotate = 180;
            break;
        case 6:
            $rotate = 90;
            break;
    }

    // Rotate the image appropriately
    $newImage = $image->rotate($rotate);  //, false);

    // Overwrite the old image with new image
    if (!$newImage->toFile($imagePath)) {
        die("Failed to overwrite file: " . $imagePath);
    }
}
