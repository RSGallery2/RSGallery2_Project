Summary of Changes
Background

If you have a commercial extension (or want to add dynamic parameters to 
your update call) you can relay on the "extra_query" field from this 
patch or use a "installer" plugin which was implemented in this patch. 
But that means, if you have an plugin/module/extension you'll have to 
ship an extra update plugin or adjust the database row with (e.g.) 
credentials.

The Idea

A lot of components/Modules shiping a helper file which can be used for 
a lot of additional tasks (like language associaction in components or 
Ajax calls in Modules). With this patch a developer cann add a 
"prepareUpdate" method to his/her helper file which will be called before 
the download of the update will be started. That means, the method could 
augment the download url with own parameters on the fly (e.g. append 
a key) without shipping an update plugin.
Also for plugins itself it looked strange for me to ship an plugin 
for updating a plugin. So this patch just make sure, that the plugin 
itself is loaded, so the update call can be implemented in the plugin 
itself.
