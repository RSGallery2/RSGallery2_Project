kept playing and came up with this straightforward way to get the token 
from the plugin, no hacks.

$profile = UserHelper::getProfile(Factory::getApplication()->getIdentity()->id);
$api_token = $profile->joomlatoken['token'];

I found getProfile() triggers the plugin in the right context to call 
getTokenForDisplay() and the token and its enabled state are returned. 

-------------------------------------------
We have com_ajax for when your auth'd to the UI of Joomla. 
The core api auth token's aren't suitable for use case within the UI. 
It was decided that it was too complicated for the average developer 
in the ecosystem. Hence we stuck with com_ajax which already existed
