How to load a layout component or a view in the module
(Display the component view or layout into a module)

https://joomla.stackexchange.com/questions/28000/display-the-component-view-or-layout-into-a-module

>> Check out a Joomla core module like /modules/mod_articles_latest 
   to see how it re-uses Joomla's ContentModelArticles.

   In the /tmpl/default.php I would put the html + php to display the 
   data. As basis I would copy parts of the components html output.
