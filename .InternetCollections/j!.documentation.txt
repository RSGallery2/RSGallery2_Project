# for user documentation 
https://docs-core.sandbox.joomla.org/ (will be relocated).

How to contribute is explained here: 
https://docs-core.sandbox.joomla.org/contributors
Important for new users: The documentation uses Joomla 
as a platform, so anyone with Joomla knowledge can 
create an article via the frontend and submit it for
 publication.

Our new system for user documentation is indeed easy. It is called... Joomla. We use frontend editing. Login with the Joomla Community Portal (like for Mattermost). Easypeasy. Also see https://magazine.joomla.org/all-issues/june-2025/how-to-contribute-to-user-documentation.
