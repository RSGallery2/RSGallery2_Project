
On joomla error in ajax call (file upload) there may be some files tranfered and other may bring error -> html answer

a) Divide between answer data and HTML (test too big image)
b) Mixed answers (error was after some data already collected

----------------------------------------
Having said that, a simple try/catch will help as a workaround for the erratic behaviour if you don't want to fix it. Ie.

try {
    if ($.parseJSON(returndata) === false) A;
} catch(e) {
    // Treat as HTML here.
}
It's not pretty, but that's what you get for having an unpredictable API that isn't pretty to begin with.

----------------------------------------

try this:

data: $('form#unit').serialize() +'&x=test',
look up about jQuery form serialization
