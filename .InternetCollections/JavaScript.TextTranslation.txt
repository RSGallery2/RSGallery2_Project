

Joomla has a certain method for this. First, in view.html.php 
add all strings, what needs to be translated with this:
JText::script('VALIDATION_ERROR');

This will add your string to javascript object, what you can use later.
And in javascript, use:

Joomla.JText._('VALIDATION_ERROR')

Which will give you matching translation in current 
language. This way you can keep JS and PHP in separate files.
