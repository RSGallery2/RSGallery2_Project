
In top repository we have to do one commit for one bug with official Git message

Say your bug fix branch is called bugfix and you want to merge it into master:

git checkout master
git merge --squash bugfix
git commit
This will take all the commits from the bugfix branch, squash them into 1 commit, and merge it with your master branch.
