PHP offers another notation for control structures. 
This is especially useful when you output larger 
blocks of HTML directly - without using echo. 
Use these in template files. So they stay clear.

<?php foreach ($this->items as $i => $item) : ?>
	?php echo $item->name; ?>
	</br>
<?php endforeach; ?>

instead of 

foreach ($this->items as $i => $item) {
	echo $item->name;
	echo '</br>';
}

In this way, a single line is self-contained 
and the HTML code is still clearly structured.
