
File Pathes in Joomla (For URL paths, try using JURI::base())

JPATH_COMPONENT_ADMINISTRATOR
JPATH_COMPONENT_SITE
...

a) Following is wrong as addStyleSheet needs an URL and not a file path
    On windows xampp the first part of the path example JPATH_COMPONENT_.... 
    may include backslashes "\" instead of slashed. Then 
	addStyleSheet(JPATH_COMPONENT_ADMINISTRATOR . "/css/ControlPanel.css");
	will not open the file indicated as all dividers must be slashed "/"

b) If these constants in the component are used from the outside from model or plugin 
   the meaning may get misleading and wrong as JPATH_COMPONENT_ will have 
   other values inside model or plugin then the the component 
   code part called which uses it

JPATH_COMPONENT_ADMINISTRATOR

Difference between JPATH_SITE, JPATH_ROOT, and JPATH_BASE
JPATH_SITE is meant to represent the root path of the JSite application, just as JPATH_ADMINISTRATOR is mean to represent the root path of the JAdministrator application.
JPATH_BASE is the root path for the current requested application.... so if you are in the administrator application:
JPATH_BASE == JPATH_ADMINISTRATOR
If you are in the site application:
JPATH_BASE == JPATH_SITE
If you are in the installation application:
JPATH_BASE == JPATH_INSTALLATION.
JPATH_ROOT is the root path for the Joomla install and does not depend upon any application.

Consideration
Whilst using JPATH_COMPONENT and JPATH_COMPONENT_ADMINISTRATOR is highly useful in some cases, 
it has one big disadvantage: it immediately breaks all attempts to 
reuse the model from another component. That's something to keep in mind.
