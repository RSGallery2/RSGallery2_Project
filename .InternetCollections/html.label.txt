How to pair a label and an input

https://css-tricks.com/html-inputs-and-labels-a-love-story/


There are two ways to pair a label and an input. One is by wrapping the input in a label (implicit), and the other is by adding a for attribute to the label and an id to the input (explicit).

Think of an implicit label as hugging an input, and an explicit label as standing next to an input and holding its hand.

<label> 
  Name:
  <input type="text" name="name" />
</label>
An explicit label’s for attribute value must match its input’s id value. For example, if for has a value of name, then id should also have a value of name.

<label for="name">Name: </label>
<input type="text" id="name" name="name" />
