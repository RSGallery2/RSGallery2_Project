New Gallery:
On save the date , user oid and ... are added to the data. The ordering is set to "1" so the latest entry has the lowest order number and appears as first entry in lists

New config item
- Create variable with value in file ...\com_rsgallery2\includes\config.class.php 
- Add list/radio/ int ... to file config.xml  ...\com_rsgallery2\models\forms\config.xml 
==> If start value != 0 then use default in config 
    (it may be enough to define a value for it in class config but then leave out default in config.xml)
